# Salt Cod (Bacalhau)

## Introduction

Salt cod, known as "Bacalhau" in Portuguese, "Bacalao" in Spanish, and "Morue" in French, is a preserved fish product that has played a significant role in culinary traditions across the globe, particularly in Mediterranean, Scandinavian, and Caribbean cuisines.
