# Green Onions (Scallions)

## Introduction

Green onions, also known as scallions, are a versatile and widely used vegetable in culinary arts around the globe. They belong to the Allium family, which also includes garlic, onions, and leeks. Characterized by their long green stalks and white bulb ends, green onions impart a milder flavor compared to their bulbous counterparts. They are harvested young, which contributes to their fresh taste and crisp texture.

## Culinary Uses

Green onions are utilized in a myriad of culinary applications, ranging from raw garnishes to cooked dishes. They are a staple in salads, soups, stir-fries, and grilled recipes, adding both flavor and color. In Asian cuisine, green onions are essential, often used in noodle dishes, dumplings, and as a garnish for soups. They also play a significant role in Mexican and Latin American kitchens, where they are grilled whole as a side dish or finely chopped for salsas and guacamoles.

### How to Use

- **Raw**: Finely chopped green onions can be sprinkled over finished dishes as a garnish, adding a fresh, oniony bite.
- **Cooked**: They can be saut√©ed, grilled, or added to stir-fries, contributing a subtle sweetness and depth of flavor.
- **Infused**: The white and light green parts are often used to infuse oils, broths, and sauces with their delicate onion flavor.

## Where It Is Typically Used

Green onions are a global ingredient, found in kitchens from Asia to the Americas. Their adaptability makes them a favorite among chefs and home cooks alike. In Asian cuisine, they are indispensable, featured in both traditional and contemporary dishes. In Western kitchens, green onions add a fresh element to salads, potato dishes, and as a finishing touch to rich dishes like creamy pastas or stews.

## Chef's Notes

- **Selection and Storage**: Choose green onions with crisp, bright green tops and a firm white base. Avoid any with wilted or slimy parts. Store them in the refrigerator, wrapped in a damp paper towel and placed in a plastic bag, for up to a week.
- **Preparation**: Rinse green onions under cold water before use. Trim off the root ends and any damaged parts of the green tops. Both the white and green parts are edible, though the white parts have a more intense flavor.
- **Culinary Tip**: To create a visually appealing garnish, slice the green parts thinly at a sharp angle. This technique, known as "on the bias," enhances the presentation of dishes with its elongated, diagonal cuts.

Green onions are a testament to the principle that sometimes the simplest ingredients can have a profound impact on the flavor and appearance of a dish. Their versatility and accessibility make them an indispensable ingredient in the culinary world.
