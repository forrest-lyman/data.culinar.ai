# Daikon (Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus)

## Introduction

Daikon, also known as white radish, Japanese radish, Chinese radish, winter radish, and luobo, is a mild-flavored, large, white variety of radish. It is a cruciferous vegetable, belonging to the Brassicaceae family, which includes broccoli, cabbage, and kale. Characterized by its long, tubular shape, daikon can grow up to 20 inches in length and 4 inches in diameter. Its crisp texture and mild flavor make it a versatile ingredient in a variety of culinary applications, particularly in Asian cuisine.

## Culinary Uses

Daikon is widely used in Asian cooking, serving both as a main ingredient and as a complement to dishes. It can be eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. When raw, it is often grated or thinly sliced and added to salads or as a crunchy garnish. Pickled daikon, known as takuan in Japanese cuisine, is a popular condiment accompanying sushi and other dishes. Cooked daikon is featured in soups, stews, and stir-fries, where it absorbs the flavors of the dish while contributing a tender texture.

In addition to its use in traditional dishes, daikon is also juiced, contributing to health drinks, and its leaves are edible, often stir-fried or pickled.

## Chef's Notes

- Daikon radish has a significantly milder and less peppery taste compared to its smaller red counterpart. This makes it suitable for a wider range of dishes, including those where a subtle, crisp texture is desired without an overpowering radish flavor.
- When selecting daikon in the market, look for firm, smooth specimens. Avoid those with soft spots or blemishes.
- Daikon can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. It is best kept in a plastic bag to retain moisture.
- The versatility of daikon extends to its nutritional benefits; it is low in calories but rich in vitamin C and potassium.

## Growing Daikon

Daikon radishes are cool-season crops that thrive in well-drained, fertile soil. They prefer full sun but can tolerate partial shade. The planting season varies by region, with seeding in late summer to early fall for a winter harvest in temperate climates, and in cooler parts of spring or autumn in warmer areas.

1. **Soil Preparation**: Work the soil deeply, removing stones and debris, to accommodate the long roots. Incorporate well-rotted compost to ensure fertility.
2. **Sowing**: Seeds should be sown directly into the ground, as daikon does not transplant well. Plant seeds Â½ inch deep, spacing them 2 inches apart in rows that are 12 inches apart.
3. **Watering**: Provide consistent moisture, especially during the root development phase. Avoid over-watering, which can lead to splitting.
4. **Thinning**: When seedlings are a few inches tall, thin them so that they are 4-6 inches apart. This gives the roots ample room to grow.
5. **Harvesting**: Daikon radishes are typically ready to harvest in 50-70 days. The root should be large and firm. Harvest before the ground freezes, or the root becomes too large and fibrous.

Growing daikon at home can be a rewarding endeavor, providing a fresh, versatile ingredient for a variety of dishes.
