# Lemon Grass (Cymbopogon citratus)

## Introduction

Lemon grass, also known as Cymbopogon citratus, is a perennial plant renowned for its citrusy scent and flavor, which is reminiscent of lemons. Originating from tropical regions in Asia, it has become a staple in many culinary traditions around the world, particularly in Thai, Vietnamese, and other Southeast Asian cuisines. Lemon grass is not only prized for its culinary uses but also for its applications in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent.

## Culinary Uses

Lemon grass is a versatile ingredient that can be used in a variety of dishes. Its stalks are the most commonly used part in cooking. They are tough and fibrous, so they are typically either finely chopped or bruised to release their flavor before being added to dishes. Lemon grass can be used fresh, dried, or powdered, and it is a key ingredient in soups, curries, teas, and marinades. Its citrusy flavor complements chicken, seafood, and vegetable dishes exceptionally well.

### How and Where It Is Typically Used

- **Soups and Curries:** Lemon grass is a fundamental herb in many Asian soups and curries, imparting a fresh, lemony essence that brightens the dish.
- **Teas and Beverages:** Fresh or dried lemon grass can be steeped in hot water to make a refreshing and soothing tea. It is also used in cocktails and mocktails for its aromatic citrus flavor.
- **Marinades:** The stalks, when crushed and mixed with other ingredients, make for an aromatic marinade for meats and seafood.
- **Aromatics:** In addition to its direct use in dishes, lemon grass is often used to infuse cooking oils and broths with its distinctive scent and taste.

## Chef's Notes

- When preparing lemon grass, remove the outer tough layers and use only the tender part of the stalk. The lower bulb portion is the most flavorful.
- Lemon grass can be a potent flavor, so it is advisable to start with a small amount and adjust according to taste.
- For those who cannot find fresh lemon grass, the dried or powdered forms can be a convenient substitute, though they have a milder flavor.

## Growing Lemon Grass

Lemon grass is a tropical plant that thrives in warm, humid conditions. It can be grown outdoors in USDA zones 9-11 or indoors in pots where climates are cooler. The plant prefers full sunlight and well-draining soil. When growing lemon grass:

- **Planting:** It can be propagated from seed, division, or by planting stalks purchased from a grocery store. If using stalks, place them in water until roots develop before planting.
- **Care:** Water the plant regularly to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Lemon grass is relatively low maintenance but benefits from occasional trimming to encourage new growth.
- **Harvesting:** Harvest lemon grass when the stalks are about 12 inches tall and the base is about 1 inch thick. Cut the stalks at ground level with a sharp knife.

Lemon grass not only serves as a culinary delight but also adds aesthetic value to gardens with its tall, grassy foliage. Its ease of care makes it a popular choice for both experienced and novice gardeners.
