# Tarragon

## Introduction

Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) is a perennial herb in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves, which are widely used in culinary applications for their distinctive anise-like flavor. Tarragon is a key ingredient in French cuisine and is one of the herbs that make up the classic "fines herbes" blend, alongside parsley, chervil, and chives.

## Culinary Uses

Tarragon is most commonly used in French cooking, where its unique flavor profile can be found enhancing sauces, such as BÃ©arnaise, and various chicken, egg, and fish dishes. It is also used to flavor vinegars, mustards, and oils. Fresh tarragon is preferred over dried, as the drying process significantly diminishes its flavor. When using tarragon in cooking, it should be added towards the end of the cooking process to preserve its delicate flavor.

## Growing Tarragon

Tarragon thrives in a sunny location with well-drained soil. It can be grown from seed, but more commonly, it is propagated from root divisions or cuttings to ensure the desired flavor characteristics, as seed-grown plants can vary widely. There are two main varieties: French tarragon, which is considered superior for culinary use due to its finer flavor, and Russian tarragon, which is hardier but less flavorful. French tarragon does not produce viable seeds and therefore must be propagated vegetatively. The plant requires minimal maintenance, though it benefits from regular watering during dry periods and the removal of flowers to encourage leaf growth.

## Chef's Notes

- When substituting dried tarragon for fresh, use roughly one-third the specified amount, as the dried form is more concentrated.
- Tarragon pairs exceptionally well with poultry, seafood, and egg dishes, but its distinctive flavor can easily overpower, so it should be used judiciously.
- Infusing tarragon in vinegar is a simple way to preserve its flavor and create a versatile culinary ingredient that can be used in dressings, marinades, and sauces.
- To store fresh tarragon, wrap the stems in a damp paper towel and place them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator, where they can last for several weeks. Alternatively, tarragon leaves can be frozen in ice cube trays with water or oil for long-term storage.

Tarragon's unique flavor and versatility make it a cherished herb in culinary circles, particularly in French cuisine. Its cultivation is straightforward, rewarding chefs and home cooks with a fresh supply of this aromatic herb to elevate their dishes.
