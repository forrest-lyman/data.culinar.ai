# Spot Prawns

## Introduction

Spot prawns, scientifically known as *Pandalus platyceros*, are a large species of shrimp found primarily in the North Pacific Ocean. They are highly prized for their sweet, delicate flavor and firm texture, making them a sought-after delicacy in culinary circles. Spot prawns are distinguishable by their reddish-brown coloration, white spots on their first and fifth segments, and notably long rostrums.

## Usage

Spot prawns are versatile in the kitchen and can be prepared through various cooking methods including boiling, grilling, sautéing, and steaming. They are a popular choice in both Western and Asian cuisines, often featured in pasta dishes, risottos, sushi, and sashimi.
