## Chef's Notes

- The key to an excellent pizza begins with the dough. A well-hydrated dough that's allowed to ferment slowly will develop flavors and textures that are the foundation of a great pizza.
- The temperature of the oven is critical. Traditional wood-fired ovens can reach temperatures of up to 800°F (427°C), cooking pizzas in just a few minutes and imparting a distinctive charred flavor.
- Simplicity often leads to perfection. Overloading a pizza with toppings can result in a soggy crust and muddled flavors.
