# Bone Marrow

## Introduction

Bone marrow, a nutrient-rich substance found in the hollow centers of bones, is a prized ingredient in many culinary traditions around the world. Comprising primarily of fat, bone marrow also contains collagen, protein, and vitamins, making it both a flavorful and nutritious addition to dishes. Its rich, buttery texture and deep, umami flavor profile can enhance a variety of recipes, from simple spreads to complex broths and sauces.

## Culinary Uses

Bone marrow is versatile in its culinary applications. It can be roasted and spread on toast, used to enrich broths and stocks, or added to stews and soups for depth of flavor. In fine dining, marrow is often served as a delicacy, scooped out of the bone and eaten directly or used as a garnish. It is also a key component in traditional dishes such as Osso Buco, a Milanese specialty where it adds richness to the braising liquid that accompanies the veal shanks.

### How and Where It Is Typically Used

- **Roasting:** Roasted bone marrow is a simple yet luxurious dish. The bones are typically cut lengthwise or crosswise, seasoned, and roasted until the marrow is soft and slightly bubbly.
- **Broths and Stocks:** Bone marrow contributes to the gelatinous quality of broths and stocks, providing a base for soups, sauces, and gravies with enhanced mouthfeel and flavor.
- **Stews and Soups:** Pieces of bone with marrow can be simmered in stews and soups, infusing the liquid with richness and a complex flavor profile.
- **Spread:** Once cooked, marrow can be spread on toast, often accompanied by sea salt or herbs, serving as a decadent appetizer or snack.

## Chef's Notes

- When purchasing bone marrow, look for bones from grass-fed animals if possible, as they tend to have a higher quality of marrow.
- Marrow bones can be requested from your local butcher, specifying the cut depending on your intended use (lengthwise for roasting and spreading, crosswise for soups and broths).
- To enhance the flavor of roasted marrow, consider topping it with a sprinkle of coarse sea salt, fresh herbs, or a squeeze of lemon juice before serving.
- For those interested in nose-to-tail eating, utilizing bone marrow is an excellent way to honor the whole animal by reducing waste and appreciating the full spectrum of flavors and textures it has to offer.

Incorporating bone marrow into your culinary repertoire not only elevates the dishes it is used in but also connects you to a long tradition of resourceful and respectful use of animal products. Its rich flavor and luxurious texture make it a cherished ingredient among chefs and gourmands alike.
