# Tuetano (Bone Marrow)

## Introduction

Tuetano, or bone marrow, is the soft, fatty tissue found inside the cavities of bones. Rich in nutrients such as iron, vitamins, and fatty acids, it is a delicacy in many cuisines around the world. Tuetano is celebrated for its buttery texture and deep, savory flavor, making it a sought-after ingredient for chefs and gourmands alike.

## Usage

Tuetano can be utilized in a variety of culinary applications. It is often roasted and spread on toast, used to enrich broths and soups, or added to stews and sauces for added depth of flavor. In Mexican cuisine, tuetano is traditionally served within roasted beef bones, often accompanied by tortillas for scooping. It is also a key component in the classic Italian dish, osso buco.

### Culinary Techniques

- **Roasting:** Roasting bone marrow in the oven is a popular method to prepare tuetano. It is typically seasoned with salt and roasted at high heat until it becomes soft and slightly bubbly.
- **Scooping and Spreading:** Once roasted, the marrow can be scooped out of the bone and spread on toast or used as a base for sauces.
- **Broths and Soups:** Bone marrow can be simmered along with other ingredients to create rich, flavorful broths and soups.

## Chef's Notes

- When selecting bones for tuetano, look for bones that are cut lengthwise (split marrow bones) or crosswise (marrow rounds). This will make the marrow easier to access after cooking.
- Tuetano's rich flavor pairs well with acidic or tangy accompaniments, such as a simple salad with a vinaigrette dressing or pickled condiments, to cut through the fat.
- Nutritionally, bone marrow is a source of collagen, which is beneficial for skin, hair, and joint health. However, due to its high fat content, it is best enjoyed in moderation.
