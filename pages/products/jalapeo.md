# Jalapeño

## Introduction

Jalapeño peppers are a medium-sized chili pepper that is a popular ingredient in Mexican, Tex-Mex, and Southwestern American cuisine. Known for their moderate heat level and distinctive bright, grassy flavor, jalapeños are a versatile ingredient used in a wide range of culinary applications. The Scoville heat units (SHU) for jalapeños can range from 2,500 to 8,000, making them spicy without being overwhelmingly hot. They are typically harvested and consumed while green, although they can fully ripen to red.

## Culinary Uses

Jalapeños are used both fresh and cooked. They can be diced into salsas, sliced for garnishes, stuffed with cheeses or meats as appetizers, or pickled for extended use. In cooking, they are often sautéed, roasted, or grilled, which can mellow their heat and enhance their sweetness. Jalapeños are also the primary ingredient in chipotle peppers, which are smoked and dried jalapeños.

## Growing Jalapeños

Jalapeños are relatively easy to grow in a home garden. They prefer warm conditions and well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. Seeds can be started indoors and transplanted outside after the last frost, or sown directly into the ground in warmer climates. Regular watering and occasional fertilization will support their growth. Peppers typically mature in 70-80 days, and regular harvesting encourages the plant to produce more fruit.

## Chef's Notes

- When handling jalapeños, it's advisable to wear gloves to prevent irritation from the capsaicin, which is concentrated in the seeds and inner membranes.
- The heat level of jalapeños can vary significantly from one pepper to another, even within the same batch. Removing the seeds and membranes can reduce their spiciness.
- Roasting jalapeños not only softens their flesh but also adds a smoky depth to their flavor, making them an excellent addition to sauces and dips.
- For a twist on traditional pickles, try adding sliced jalapeños to the mix for an extra kick.
