# Opal Basil

## Introduction

Opal basil, scientifically known as *Ocimum basilicum* 'Purpurascens', is a distinctive variety of sweet basil. Characterized by its striking dark purple leaves, opal basil not only adds a unique color contrast to dishes but also offers a slightly different flavor profile compared to its green counterpart. This aromatic herb is valued both for its culinary versatility and ornamental appeal.

## Culinary Uses

Opal basil is utilized in a variety of culinary applications. Its vibrant purple hue makes it an excellent choice for adding color to salads, garnishes, and infused oils. The flavor of opal basil is somewhat milder than green basil, with subtle hints of clove and anise, making it well-suited for incorporating into desserts, cocktails, and vinegar. It pairs exceptionally well with tomato-based dishes, fresh cheeses like mozzarella, and fruit salads.

## Growing Opal Basil

Opal basil thrives in warm, sunny conditions and prefers well-drained soil. It can be grown both in gardens and containers, making it accessible for those with limited space. To encourage bushier plants and prevent early flowering, pinch off the tip of the plant after it has developed several sets of leaves. Regular harvesting also promotes continuous growth. Opal basil is sensitive to cold temperatures and frost, so it is best to plant it after the danger of frost has passed in your area.

### Chef's Notes

- When using opal basil in cooking, it's best to add it towards the end of the cooking process. This helps to preserve its vibrant color and delicate flavor.
- Opal basil can also be used to make a visually striking purple pesto. However, it's important to note that blending can cause the leaves to darken, so incorporating some green basil leaves can help maintain a more appealing color.
- For an eye-catching presentation, use opal basil leaves as a natural garnish on plates or floating in clear soups and beverages.

Opal basil's unique color and flavor profile make it a valuable addition to the culinary world, offering chefs and home cooks alike the opportunity to experiment with its aesthetic and taste dimensions. Whether used for its decorative appeal or as a key ingredient in a dish, opal basil is sure to leave a lasting impression.
