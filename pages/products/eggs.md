# Eggs

## Introduction

Eggs, a staple ingredient in global cuisines, are laid by female animals of many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, a few mammals, and fish. Predominantly, the eggs referred to in culinary contexts are those laid by chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). Eggs are highly valued in culinary arts for their versatility, nutritional content, and unique properties that contribute to various cooking and baking processes.

## How and Where Eggs are Typically Used

### Culinary Uses:

- **Binding and Coating**: Eggs are used as a binding agent in dishes like meatballs and as a wash for breading.
- **Leavening**: In baking, beaten eggs can incorporate air into batters, aiding in leavening and providing structure to cakes and souffl√©s.
- **Emulsifying**: Egg yolks contain lecithin, making them excellent for creating stable emulsions in sauces like mayonnaise and hollandaise.
- **Thickening**: Eggs are used to thicken custards, creams, and sauces due to their coagulation properties when heated.
- **Glazing**: Beaten eggs are brushed on pastries and bread before baking to impart a glossy finish.
- **Direct Consumption**: Eggs are consumed directly in various forms, including boiled, scrambled, poached, fried, and baked.

### Nutritional Value:

Eggs are a rich source of protein, vitamins (especially B12 and D), minerals (such as selenium and phosphorus), and antioxidants. They contain all nine essential amino acids, making them a complete protein source.

### Chef's Notes:

- **Freshness Test**: To test an egg's freshness, place it in a bowl of water. Fresh eggs will sink and lie flat on their sides, while older eggs will stand upright or float due to the increased air cell inside the shell.
- **Size Matters**: Egg sizes (e.g., medium, large, extra-large) can affect the outcome in baking. Recipes typically assume the use of large eggs unless otherwise specified.
- **Temperature**: Bringing eggs to room temperature before use in baking can result in better emulsification and volume.
- **Separating Eggs**: When separating yolks from whites, ensure no yolk contaminates the whites, especially if you plan to whip the whites, as fat from the yolk can prevent them from reaching full volume.

Eggs' remarkable versatility and nutritional profile make them indispensable in both sweet and savory culinary applications, from simple breakfast dishes to complex desserts and sauces. Their unique chemical properties allow chefs and bakers to achieve textures and flavors that are difficult to replicate with any other ingredient.
