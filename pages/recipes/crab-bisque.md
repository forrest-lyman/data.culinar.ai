ek# Crab Bisque

Crab Bisque is a rich, creamy soup that is a classic in French cuisine, particularly from the Normandy region, known for its luxurious seafood dishes. This bisque is made with a base of crab meat, seafood stock, and heavy cream, often finished with a touch of brandy or sherry, creating a deeply flavorful and elegant soup. Perfect for a sophisticated starter or a light main course, crab bisque is a testament to the finesse of French cooking techniques.

- **Origin**: France (Normandy)
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 cup

## Ingredients

### For the Stock:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Shells from 1 pound of fresh crabs
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tomato, chopped
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 4 cups water

### For the Bisque:
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup celery, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups seafood stock (from above)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 pound crab meat, picked over for shells
- 2 tablespoons brandy or sherry
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

### Preparing the Stock:
1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the crab shells, onion, carrot, celery, garlic, tomato, bay leaf, and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.
2. Pour in the white wine and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
3. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Set the stock aside.

### Making the Bisque:
1. In a clean pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and celery, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in the flour to form a roux, cooking for 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
3. Gradually whisk in the prepared seafood stock until smooth. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the heavy cream and crab meat. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
5. Stir in the brandy or sherry, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley.

### Chef's Notes:
- For an extra smooth bisque, you can blend the soup in batches in a blender or use an immersion blender before adding the crab meat.
- If fresh crabs are not available, you can substitute with high-quality canned crab meat, but the depth of flavor from using fresh crabs and making your own stock is unparalleled.
- A touch of cayenne pepper can be added for those who prefer a bit of heat in their bisque.
