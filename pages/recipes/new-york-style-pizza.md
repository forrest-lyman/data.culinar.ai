- 1 1/3 cups of warm water (around 110°F)
- 3 1/2 cups of bread flour, plus more for dusting
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil, plus more for greasing
- 2 teaspoons of sugar
- 1 teaspoon of salt

### Sauce
- 1 can (15 oz) of crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (optional)

### Toppings
- 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
- Additional toppings as desired (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, etc.)

## Instructions

### Dough
1. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit until frothy, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the flour, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.
3. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface into a 14-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan or baking sheet.

### Sauce
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, olive oil, sugar, oregano, salt, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes.
2. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let it cool.

### Assembly
1. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).
2. Spread the sauce evenly over the prepared dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
3. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the sauce. Add any additional toppings as desired.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly, about 12-15 minutes.
5. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

### Chef's Notes
- For an authentic New York-style experience, the pizza should be large enough to require folding to eat.
- The key to a crispy crust is a very hot oven. If you have a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven and bake your pizza on it for the best results.
- Bread flour is preferred for its higher protein content, which contributes to the chewy texture of the crust.
