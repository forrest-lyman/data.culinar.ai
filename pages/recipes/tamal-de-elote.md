# Tamal de Elote

Tamal de Elote, or Corn Tamale, is a traditional dish originating from various regions across Latin America, with notable popularity in Mexico and Central America. Unlike the more commonly known tamal wrapped in corn husks, Tamal de Elote is characterized by its sweet, moist texture and is made from fresh corn kernels rather than masa harina. This dish is often enjoyed as a dessert or a sweet snack during various festivities and family gatherings.

- **Origin**: Latin America (notably Mexico and Central America)
- **Yield**: 12 servings
- **Portion Size**: 1 tamal

## Ingredients

### For the Tamal
- 6 cups of fresh corn kernels (about 6-8 ears of corn, depending on size)
- 1 cup of unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup of granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon of baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 cup of milk (whole or 2%)

### For Wrapping
- 12 large corn husks, soaked in warm water for at least an hour

## Instructions

### Preparing the Corn Husks
1. Ensure the corn husks are thoroughly soaked and pliable. This will make them easier to fold and will prevent tearing when wrapping the tamales.

### Making the Tamal Batter
1. Start by removing the corn kernels from the cobs. Use a sharp knife and cut down the length of the cob to cleanly remove the kernels.
2. In a blender or food processor, blend the corn kernels with milk until you achieve a smooth consistency.
3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This can take about 3-5 minutes with an electric mixer.
4. Gradually add the blended corn mixture to the creamed butter and sugar, mixing until well combined.
5. Sift together the baking powder and salt, then fold into the corn mixture until the batter is uniform.

### Assembling the Tamales
1. Drain the corn husks and pat them dry with a towel. Lay a husk flat on your work surface.
2. Place about 1/2 cup of the tamal batter in the center of each husk.
3. Fold the sides of the husk inward over the batter, then fold the bottom of the husk up. You can tie the tamal with a strip of corn husk to secure it, but this is optional.
4. Repeat with the remaining batter and husks.

### Cooking the Tamales
1. Prepare a steamer with water and bring it to a simmer. Arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer basket, with the open end up.
2. Cover and steam for about 60-75 minutes, or until the tamales are firm and the husk easily separates from the tamal.
3. Let the tamales rest for a few minutes before serving. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.

## Chef's Notes
- Fresh corn is key to the authentic flavor of Tamal de Elote, but if it's out of season, frozen corn kernels can be a suitable substitute. Ensure they are thawed and drained before use.
- For a richer flavor, some variations of this recipe include adding a small amount of condensed milk or creamed corn to the batter.
- Tamal de Elote can be served with a dollop of sour cream or a sprinkle of cheese for those who prefer a savory twist.
