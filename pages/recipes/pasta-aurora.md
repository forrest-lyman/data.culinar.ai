- **Origin**: Italy
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 1/2 cups per serving

## Ingredients

### For the Aurora Sauce
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving

### For the Pasta
- 1 pound (450g) pasta, such as penne or fettuccine
- Salt, for the pasta water

## Instructions

### Preparing the Aurora Sauce
1. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the chopped onion and sautÃ© until translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant.
3. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
4. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream and grated Parmesan cheese. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the sauce is heated through and slightly thickened. Adjust seasoning to taste.

### Cooking the Pasta
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
2. Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the pasta water.

### Combining Pasta and Sauce
1. Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the Aurora sauce, tossing to coat evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.
2. Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese.

## Chef's Notes
- For a variation of this dish, consider adding cooked chicken, shrimp, or vegetables to the sauce for added texture and flavor.
- The optional sugar in the sauce helps to balance the acidity of the tomatoes, creating a smoother, more rounded flavor.
