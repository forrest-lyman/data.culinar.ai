# Beer Battered Fish

This classic Beer Battered Fish recipe is a staple in British cuisine, particularly famous as part of the iconic fish and chips dish. Originating from the United Kingdom, this dish is celebrated for its crispy, golden exterior and tender, flaky interior. The beer in the batter not only adds a unique flavor but also contributes to the lightness and crispiness of the fried coating.

- **Origin**: United Kingdom
- **Yield**: 4 servings
- **Portion Size**: 2 pieces per serving

## Ingredients

- 4 large fish fillets (cod, haddock, or pollock are preferred), about 6-8 ounces each
- 1 cup all-purpose flour (plus extra for dredging)
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 cups cold beer (lager or ale for best results)
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- Lemon wedges, for serving
- Tartar sauce, for serving

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Fish**: Begin by patting the fish fillets dry with paper towels. This is crucial for the batter to adhere properly. Set aside on a plate.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, sift together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine evenly.

3. **Add Beer**: Gradually pour in the cold beer into the dry ingredients while whisking continuously. Whisk until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. The consistency should be similar to that of pancake batter; if it's too thick, add a bit more beer. Let the batter sit for about 15 minutes before using to allow the flavors to meld.

4. **Heat Oil**: In a deep fryer or a large, deep skillet, heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil to 375°F (190°C). Use a cooking thermometer to ensure accuracy.

5. **Dredge and Batter the Fish**: Lightly dredge each fish fillet in some all-purpose flour, shaking off any excess. Then, dip the fillet into the beer batter, ensuring it's completely coated.

6. **Fry the Fish**: Carefully lower the battered fish into the hot oil. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding, which can lower the oil's temperature and result in soggy fish. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the fish from the oil and drain on a wire rack or paper towels.

7. **Serve**: Serve the beer battered fish hot with lemon wedges and tartar sauce on the side. Traditional accompaniments include thick-cut fries (chips) and mushy peas.

## Chef's Notes

- The key to a light and crispy batter is the temperature of the beer; it should be as cold as possible.
- Adjust the frying oil temperature between batches if necessary. If the oil is too hot, the batter will brown too quickly without cooking the fish through. If it's too cool, the batter will absorb too much oil and become soggy.
- For an extra touch of flavor, consider adding a teaspoon of paprika or garlic powder to the batter mix.
