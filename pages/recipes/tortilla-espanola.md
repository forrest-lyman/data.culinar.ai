- 1 clove [garlic](/page/product/garlic-1709152798318), minced

## Instructions

### Preparing the Potatoes and Onions
1. Heat the olive oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the sliced potatoes and onions, ensuring they are evenly coated in oil. Season with salt.
2. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender but not browned, about 20-25 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent browning.
3. Once cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer the potatoes and onions to a large bowl. Let them cool slightly. Reserve the oil in the pan.

### Making the Omelette
1. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt. Add the cooked potatoes and onions (and parsley and garlic if using) to the eggs, gently mixing to ensure the vegetables are evenly coated.
2. Heat the reserved oil in the pan over medium heat. Pour the egg and vegetable mixture into the pan, spreading it evenly.
3. Cook the mixture on a low heat for about 10 minutes, or until the bottom is lightly browned and the top is somewhat set.
4. Carefully place a large plate over the pan, and invert the omelette onto the plate. Then, slide the omelette back into the pan to cook the other side, about 3-5 minutes more.
5. Once fully cooked, transfer the Tortilla Espa単ola to a plate. It can be served hot, at room temperature, or cold.

### Chef's Notes
- The key to a perfect Tortilla Espa単ola is the potato-to-egg ratio and the cooking time. The potatoes should be fully enveloped by the egg, creating a tender, cohesive omelette.
- For a lighter version, some cooks prefer to parboil the potatoes before frying them, reducing the amount of oil needed.
- This dish is incredibly versatile. Feel free to add chorizo, bell peppers, or cheese for a different flavor profile.
