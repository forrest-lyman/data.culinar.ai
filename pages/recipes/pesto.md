## Origin
[Italy](/page/region/italy-1709155281386) (Liguria)

## Yield
This recipe makes about 1 cup of pesto.

## Portion Size
1 tablespoon (approximately 15 servings per cup)

## Ingredients
- 2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1/3 cup pine nuts
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Basil:** Rinse the basil leaves in cold water and gently pat them dry with paper towels. It's important to remove as much moisture as possible to prevent the pesto from becoming too watery.

2. **Blend the Ingredients:** In a food processor, combine the basil leaves, garlic, and pine nuts. Pulse until coarsely chopped. Add the grated Parmesan cheese and blend until fully incorporated.

3. **Emulsify with Olive Oil:** With the food processor running, slowly pour in the olive oil in a steady stream. This process helps to emulsify the ingredients, creating a smooth and cohesive sauce. Continue processing until the pesto reaches your desired consistency.

4. **Season:** Taste the pesto and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Adjust the seasoning according to your preference.

5. **Storage:** If not using immediately, transfer the pesto to an airtight container and pour a thin layer of olive oil on top. This helps to preserve the vibrant green color. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or freeze for longer storage.

## Chef's Notes
- **Substitutions:** While pine nuts are traditional in pesto, they can be substituted with walnuts or almonds for a different flavor profile or to accommodate allergies.
- **Cheese Variations:** Parmesan is the classic choice, but Pecorino Romano can also be used for a sharper flavor.
- **Using Pesto:** Beyond pasta, try using pesto as a marinade for grilled vegetables or chicken, as a flavorful addition to salad dressings, or stirred into soups for added depth.
- **Preserving Color:** To maintain the bright green color of the pesto, blanching the basil leaves briefly in boiling water and then shocking them in ice water before drying and proceeding with the recipe can help, though this step is optional and not traditional.
