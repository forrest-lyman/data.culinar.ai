# Ahi Tuna Poke

Ahi Tuna Poke is a traditional Hawaiian dish that has gained international popularity for its fresh, savory, and slightly spicy flavors. Originating from Hawaii, this dish is a testament to the islands' love for fresh seafood. It is typically served as an appetizer or a light meal.

- **Origin**: Hawaii, USA
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 cup per serving

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh ahi tuna (sashimi grade), diced into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1/4 cup soy sauce (preferably low sodium)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon honey or agave nectar
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion (sweet or red onion preferred)
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1 avocado, diced (optional)
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Tuna**: Start by ensuring the ahi tuna is properly chilled and fresh. Dice the tuna into uniform 1/2-inch cubes for even marination and set aside in a medium mixing bowl.

2. **Mixing the Sauce**: In a separate small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, honey, and grated ginger until well combined. This mixture will serve as the poke marinade, infusing the tuna with a rich, savory flavor profile.

3. **Combining Ingredients**: Pour the marinade over the diced tuna, ensuring each piece is evenly coated. Add the sliced green onions, chopped onion, and crushed red pepper flakes to the bowl. Gently fold the ingredients together to distribute the flavors evenly. Be careful not to mash the tuna cubes to maintain their texture.

4. **Final Touches**: Allow the mixture to sit for at least 15 minutes in the refrigerator to marinate. This resting period allows the flavors to meld together and the tuna to absorb the marinade. For a richer texture and flavor, consider adding diced avocado to the poke just before serving.

5. **Serving**: Once marinated, give the poke one final gentle stir. Taste and adjust seasoning with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, if necessary. Serve the poke chilled, garnished with toasted sesame seeds for an added nutty flavor and a visually appealing finish.

## Chef's Notes

- **Serving Suggestions**: Ahi tuna poke can be served in various ways - over a bed of sushi rice, on top of a crisp salad, or even in a poke bowl with your choice of accompaniments like cucumber, radish, and seaweed salad.
- **Adjusting Heat**: The level of spiciness in poke can be adjusted according to personal preference. The crushed red pepper flakes can be increased for more heat or omitted for a milder version.
