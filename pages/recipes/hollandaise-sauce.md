# Hollandaise Sauce

Hollandaise sauce, a staple of French cuisine, is a rich, buttery, and lemony sauce that is often served over vegetables, fish, or eggs, particularly in the classic dish Eggs Benedict. Its origins trace back to France, and it is considered one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine. The sauce is known for its delicate balance of flavors and its emulsified consistency, which requires careful preparation to achieve.

- **Origin**: France
- **Yield**: About 1 cup
- **Portion Size**: 2 tablespoons

## Ingredients

- 3 large egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste
- A pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare a Double Boiler**: Fill a saucepan with about an inch of water and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Find a heatproof bowl that can sit on top of the saucepan without touching the water.

2. **Whisk Egg Yolks**: In the heatproof bowl, combine the egg yolks, water, and lemon juice. Whisk until the mixture is light and frothy.

3. **Cook the Mixture**: Place the bowl over the simmering water (the double boiler setup). Whisk vigorously and continuously, making sure the eggs don’t get too hot and scramble. The mixture will gradually thicken and double in volume, forming a ribbon-like consistency when the whisk is lifted, which should take about 3 to 5 minutes.

4. **Add Butter**: Remove the bowl from heat. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking constantly to form an emulsion. The sauce should become thick and smooth.

5. **Season**: Season with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper (if using). Adjust the lemon juice to taste.

6. **Serve Immediately**: Hollandaise sauce is best served fresh and warm. If it needs to be held for a short period, keep it in a warm spot, like a warm water bath, and whisk before serving to ensure it remains emulsified and smooth.

## Chef's Notes

- **Temperature Control**: Maintaining the right temperature is crucial. If the sauce gets too hot, the eggs will scramble. If it's too cool, the sauce won't thicken. Keeping the water at a gentle simmer is key.
- **Fixing Broken Sauce**: If the sauce begins to separate or curdle, whisk in a tablespoon of cold water. If it's severely broken, start with a fresh yolk in a new bowl, and gradually whisk in the broken sauce.
- **Variations**: Hollandaise can be the base for other sauces. For example, adding tarragon and shallots gives you Béarnaise sauce, a classic with steak.
- **Storage**: Hollandaise is best enjoyed fresh. It does not store well as it can separate or spoil easily.
