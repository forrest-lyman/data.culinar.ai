# Neapolitan Pizza

Neapolitan Pizza, or Pizza Napoletana, is a type of pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. This traditional Italian cuisine is known for its simple yet high-quality ingredients and its unique preparation and cooking method. The dough is hand-kneaded and must be baked in a wood-fired oven at a high temperature for a short time. Neapolitan pizza is characterized by its thin center and puffy, charred edges, known as the "cornicione."

- **Origin**: Naples, Italy
- **Yield**: 4 Pizzas
- **Portion Size**: 1 Pizza per person

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- 500g (4 cups) '00' flour, plus extra for dusting
- 325ml (1⅓ cups) lukewarm water
- 2g (½ tsp) dry yeast
- 10g (2 tsp) sea salt

### For the Topping
- 400g (14 oz) canned San Marzano tomatoes, hand-crushed
- 300g (10.5 oz) fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Sea salt, to taste

## Instructions

### Preparing the Dough
1. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water and let it sit for a few minutes.
2. Add the flour and salt to the bowl and mix until the ingredients start to combine. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until it's smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts, shape each into a ball, and place them on a floured tray. Cover with a damp cloth and let them rise at room temperature for at least 8 hours or overnight.

### Shaping the Dough
1. Place a dough ball on a floured surface. Using your fingers, gently press the dough, starting from the center and working your way out, leaving the edges a bit thicker to form the crust.
2. Carefully stretch the dough by draping it over your knuckles, rotating and stretching it until it reaches about 10 inches in diameter. Be careful not to tear the dough.

### Topping and Baking
1. Preheat your wood-fired oven to 485°C (905°F). If using a conventional oven, preheat it to the highest temperature possible, placing a pizza stone or heavy baking sheet inside to heat.
2. Spread a thin layer of crushed tomatoes over the base of the stretched dough. Add a few slices of mozzarella and a few basil leaves. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt.
3. Carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake in the wood-fired oven for about 60-90 seconds or in the conventional oven for 4-5 minutes, or until the crust is puffed and charred in spots and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
4. Remove from the oven, let it cool for a minute, then slice and serve immediately.

### Chef's Notes
- The key to an authentic Neapolitan pizza is the high hydration dough and the extremely high cooking temperature. This combination yields a pizza with a soft, tender base and a beautifully blistered crust.
- Using '00' flour is crucial for achieving the right texture in the dough. This finely ground Italian flour creates a light and airy crust.
- San Marzano tomatoes are preferred for their sweet flavor and low acidity, making them perfect for pizza sauce.
