- **Origin**: Texas, USA

- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 cup

## Ingredients

### For the Chili Paste:
- 4 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 2 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 2 dried chipotle chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 3 cups beef broth, divided
- 2 tablespoons cumin seeds
- 2 tablespoons coriander seeds
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 2 whole cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick

### For the Chili:
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 pounds beef chuck, trimmed and cut into Â½-inch cubes
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1-2 cups water, as needed

## Instructions

### Preparing the Chili Paste:
1. Toast the ancho, guajillo, and chipotle chiles in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with 2 cups of hot beef broth. Let them soak until soft, about 30 minutes.
2. In the same skillet, toast the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon stick until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Grind these spices in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle until finely ground.
3. Transfer the soaked chiles and their liquid to a blender. Add the ground spice mixture. Blend until smooth, adding up to 1 cup more beef broth as needed to form a thick paste. Set aside.

### Making the Chili:
1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef in batches, browning on all sides. Transfer the browned beef to a plate.
2. In the same pot, reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and garlic, cooking until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Return the beef to the pot. Stir in the chili paste, oregano, ground cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika, and tomato sauce. Mix well to ensure the beef is thoroughly coated.
4. Add the apple cider vinegar and enough water to just cover the beef. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beef is tender and the chili has thickened, about 2-3 hours. Add more water as needed if the chili becomes too thick.
5. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper if necessary. Serve hot.

### Chef's Notes:
- For a more authentic flavor, try sourcing Mexican oregano and using freshly ground spices.
- This chili is traditionally served without beans, focusing on the rich flavors of the meat and chilies. However, it can be customized with beans or other additions according to personal preference.
- The chili tastes even better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld together.
