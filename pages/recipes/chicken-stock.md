# Classic Chicken Stock

A fundamental component in culinary arts, chicken stock is a versatile and richly flavored liquid used as a base for soups, sauces, and many other dishes. Originating from various culinary traditions around the world, it embodies the essence of chicken and aromatic vegetables simmered to perfection. This recipe focuses on a clear, golden stock that can elevate any dish it accompanies.

- **Origin**: International
- **Yield**: Approximately 4 liters
- **Portion Size**: Variable

## Ingredients

### For the Stock
- 3 kg chicken bones, preferably a mix of necks, backs, and wings
- 4 liters cold water
- 2 medium onions, quartered
- 2 carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped
- 2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped
- 1 leek, white part only, coarsely chopped (optional)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- A few sprigs of fresh thyme
- A few sprigs of fresh parsley

## Instructions

### Preparing the Ingredients
1. Begin by rinsing the chicken bones under cold water to remove any impurities. This step ensures a clearer stock.
2. In a large stockpot, combine the chicken bones and cold water. The cold water helps in extracting the flavors gradually as it heats.
3. Slowly bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat. As it begins to simmer, foam will rise to the surface.

### Skimming and Simmering
1. Use a ladle or a skimmer to carefully remove the foam from the surface. This is crucial for achieving a clear stock.
2. Once the foam has been removed, add the onions, carrots, celery, leek (if using), bay leaves, peppercorns, thyme, and parsley to the pot.
3. Reduce the heat to low, ensuring the stock maintains a gentle simmer. A vigorous boil can make the stock cloudy.
4. Allow the stock to simmer uncovered for 3 to 4 hours, occasionally skimming any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.

### Straining and Cooling
1. After simmering, remove the stock from the heat and carefully strain it through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth into a clean pot or large container. This step removes the solid ingredients and any remaining impurities.
2. Cool the stock quickly to prevent bacterial growth. One effective method is to fill a sink with ice water and place the container of stock in the ice bath, stirring occasionally to cool evenly.
3. Once cooled, transfer the stock to storage containers. It can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

### Chef's Notes
- Roasting the bones and vegetables at 400°F (200°C) for about 30 minutes before simmering can add depth and a richer color to the stock.
- Avoid adding salt during the cooking process. Seasoning the stock should be done when it's being used in a final dish, allowing for better control over the seasoning.
