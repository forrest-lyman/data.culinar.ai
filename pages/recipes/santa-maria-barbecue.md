# Santa Maria Barbecue

Santa Maria Barbecue is a regional culinary tradition rooted in California's Central Coast, specifically in Santa Maria Valley. This cooking style is characterized by its open-flame grilling of beef, typically tri-tip, which is a cut that has gained popularity far beyond its origins due to its rich flavor and tender texture. The meat is seasoned with a simple but distinctive rub and served with a set of traditional accompaniments that highlight the local produce and flavors.

- **Origin**: Santa Maria Valley, California, USA
- **Yield**: Serves 6-8
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 6-8 ounces per person

## Ingredients

### For the Tri-Tip
- 2-3 lbs tri-tip roast
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 2 tablespoons coarse salt
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)

### For the Salsa
- 3 medium tomatoes, finely chopped
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced (optional)
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Additional Accompaniments
- Pinquito beans, cooked
- Grilled French bread
- Green salad

## Instructions

### Preparing the Tri-Tip
1. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, coarse salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper to create the rub.
2. Apply the rub generously over the entire surface of the tri-tip roast. Let the seasoned meat sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.
3. Preheat the grill to a high heat. If using charcoal, prepare for indirect grilling by situating the coals on one side.
4. Place the tri-tip on the grill, fat side up, over direct heat for about 5-7 minutes to sear. Flip and sear the other side.
5. Move the tri-tip to indirect heat (or lower the gas grill's heat to medium-low) and cover. Cook for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 130°F for medium-rare.
6. Remove the tri-tip from the grill and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.

### Preparing the Salsa
1. In a medium bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, red onion, jalapeño (if using), cilantro, and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the salsa sit for at least 10 minutes to meld the flavors.

### Serving
1. Slice the rested tri-tip against the grain into thin slices.
2. Serve the sliced beef alongside the fresh salsa, pinquito beans, grilled French bread, and a green salad.

### Chef's Notes
- The key to a perfect Santa Maria Barbecue is not just in the seasoning, but also in the method of grilling. The initial sear locks in the flavors, while the indirect grilling allows the tri-tip to cook evenly without drying out.
- Pinquito beans are a small pink bean native to the Santa Maria region and are a traditional side dish for this barbecue. If unavailable, small red beans or pinto beans can be used as a substitute.
