# Barbecue Chicken

Barbecue chicken is a popular dish in American cuisine, known for its smoky flavor, tender meat, and the tangy sweetness of barbecue sauce. Originating from the Southern United States, this dish has become a staple at outdoor gatherings and picnics across the country. The key to perfect barbecue chicken lies in the marinade and the slow grilling process, which allows the meat to absorb the flavors while maintaining its juiciness.

- **Origin**: Southern United States
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: 1 to 2 pieces per person

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 4 chicken breasts (bone-in, skin-on) or 8 chicken thighs
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

### For the Barbecue Sauce
- 1 cup ketchup
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon yellow mustard
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)

## Instructions

### Preparing the Chicken
1. Preheat your grill to a medium heat of around 350째F (175째C).
2. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then brush them lightly with olive oil. This helps in creating a crispy skin.
3. Place the chicken on the grill, skin-side down, and cook for about 5-7 minutes until the skin starts to crisp and has grill marks.
4. Flip the chicken and continue grilling for another 5-7 minutes. The goal is to achieve an even cook on both sides before applying the barbecue sauce.

### Making the Barbecue Sauce
1. While the chicken is grilling, prepare the barbecue sauce. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine all the sauce ingredients.
2. Stir the mixture well and bring to a simmer. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10 minutes, or until it thickens slightly. Adjust the seasoning to taste.

### Finishing the Chicken
1. Once the chicken has grilled on both sides, start applying the barbecue sauce generously using a brush. Cover the chicken pieces with the sauce on all sides.
2. Reduce the grill's heat to low and close the lid. Let the chicken cook for another 10-15 minutes, turning once and basting with more sauce every few minutes. This process helps in building up a flavorful glaze.
3. The chicken is done when it reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C) when checked with a meat thermometer.
4. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.

### Chef's Notes
- For an authentic smoky flavor, consider adding wood chips to your grill if using a charcoal or smoker grill.
- The barbecue sauce can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to a week, allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully.
- Leftover barbecue chicken makes excellent sandwiches or can be shredded for salads.
