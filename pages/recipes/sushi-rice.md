# Sushi Rice

Sushi rice, also known as Shari or Sumeshi, is a fundamental component of Japanese sushi. This seasoned, vinegared rice serves as the base for a wide variety of sushi dishes, including nigiri, maki, and temaki. The perfect sushi rice is slightly sticky, allowing it to hold its shape, yet each grain remains distinct and not mushy. Achieving the right balance of sweetness, saltiness, and acidity is key to authentic sushi rice.

- **Origin**: Japan
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 cup per serving

## Ingredients

- 2 cups sushi or short-grain rice
- 2 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 cup rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. **Rinse the Rice**: Place the sushi rice in a large bowl. Fill with cold water and gently stir the rice with your hands. Drain and repeat this process 3-4 times, or until the water runs clear. This step removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.

2. **Cook the Rice**: Transfer the rinsed rice to a rice cooker or a medium saucepan. Add 2 1/2 cups of water. If using a rice cooker, cook according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stovetop cooking, bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes.

3. **Prepare the Sushi Vinegar**: While the rice is cooking, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Warm over low heat, stirring until the sugar and salt dissolve completely. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.

4. **Season the Rice**: Transfer the cooked rice to a large, wide bowl, preferably wooden (a traditional hangiri if available). Sprinkle the sushi vinegar mixture over the rice. Using a rice paddle or a wide spatula, gently fold the rice to evenly distribute the seasoning, while being careful not to mash the grains. Fan the rice while mixing to help it cool to room temperature more quickly and give it a glossy finish.

5. **Rest the Rice**: Cover the bowl with a damp cloth until ready to use. This prevents the rice from drying out.

## Chef's Notes

- **Rice Quality**: Using high-quality sushi or short-grain rice is crucial for the best texture and flavor.
- **Cooling the Rice**: Cooling the rice quickly after seasoning is important for achieving the perfect texture and preventing it from becoming overly sticky.
- **Storage**: Sushi rice is best used the same day it is made. However, if necessary, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Cover it with a damp cloth and gently reheat in the microwave before using.
