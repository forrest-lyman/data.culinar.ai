# Traditional Mexican Carnitas

Carnitas, which means "little meats" in Spanish, is a beloved dish originating from the Michoacán region of Mexico. This dish is celebrated for its tender, flavorful pork that is both braised and fried to achieve a perfect balance of juiciness and crispiness. Carnitas are versatile and can be served in tacos, burritos, or simply enjoyed on their own with a side of salsa and tortillas.

- **Origin**: Michoacán, Mexico
- **Yield**: Serves 8
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 4 ounces per serving

## Ingredients

- 4 lbs pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 1 medium white onion, quartered
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2 bay leaves
- Juice of 1 orange
- Water, enough to cover the pork
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil or lard

### For Serving

- Warm corn tortillas
- Chopped cilantro
- Diced onion
- Lime wedges
- Salsa of choice

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Pork**: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine the pork shoulder chunks, quartered onion, garlic cloves, salt, black pepper, dried oregano, ground cumin, and bay leaves. Add the juice of one orange and then add enough water to just cover the pork.

2. **Cooking**: Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 2 to 2.5 hours, or until the pork is very tender and falls apart easily.

3. **Reducing Liquid**: Once the pork is tender, remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the water has evaporated and the pork begins to fry in its own fat. This process can take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. Be careful to stir the pork occasionally to ensure it fries evenly and does not stick to the bottom of the pot.

4. **Frying Pork**: After the water has evaporated, add the vegetable oil or lard to the pot. Continue to cook the pork, stirring frequently, until it is golden and crispy on the outside. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.

5. **Serving**: Once the pork is crispy, remove it from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes. Then, using two forks, shred the pork into smaller pieces. Serve the carnitas with warm corn tortillas, chopped cilantro, diced onion, lime wedges, and your choice of salsa.

### Chef's Notes

- For an authentic touch, try using lard instead of vegetable oil for frying the pork. Lard is traditional in Mexican cooking and adds a depth of flavor to the carnitas.
- The addition of orange juice not only tenderizes the pork but also adds a subtle sweetness that balances the savory spices.
- Carnitas can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Reheat in a skillet over medium heat until crispy again.
