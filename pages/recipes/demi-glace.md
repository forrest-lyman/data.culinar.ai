# Classic Demi-Glace

Demi-glace is a rich brown sauce in French cuisine that forms the base for many other sauces and dishes. It is made by reducing a mixture of half brown stock and half brown sauce (Espagnole) until it achieves a thick, syrup-like consistency. This sauce is renowned for its ability to add depth and flavor to dishes, making it a staple in fine dining establishments. Originating from France, it is a testament to the sophistication and complexity of French culinary techniques.

## Ingredients

### For the Brown Stock
- 2 kg beef bones, roasted
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 leek, white part only, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- 1 bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaf, parsley stems)
- 4 liters water

### For the Espagnole Sauce
- 50g butter
- 60g flour
- 1.5 liters brown stock (from above)
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tomatoes, peeled and seeded
- 1 bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaf, parsley stems)

### For the Demi-Glace
- 1.5 liters Espagnole sauce (from above)
- 1.5 liters brown stock (from above)

## Instructions

### Brown Stock
1. Preheat your oven to 220°C (430°F). Place the beef bones on a roasting tray and roast for 1 hour, or until deeply browned.
2. Transfer the roasted bones to a large stockpot. Add the chopped vegetables and bouquet garni. Cover with 4 liters of water and bring to a gentle simmer.
3. Simmer for 6-8 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface. Strain the stock through a fine sieve, discarding the solids.

### Espagnole Sauce
1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour, stirring constantly, to make a roux. Cook until the roux turns a light brown color, about 6-7 minutes.
2. Gradually whisk in 1.5 liters of the prepared brown stock, ensuring there are no lumps. Add the diced vegetables, garlic, tomatoes, and bouquet garni.
3. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 1 hour, or until reduced by one-third. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve, discarding the solids.

### Demi-Glace
1. Combine the Espagnole sauce and the remaining brown stock in a large saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer.
2. Reduce the mixture over low heat for about 2-3 hours, or until it has reduced by half and coats the back of a spoon.
3. Strain the demi-glace through a fine sieve. It is now ready to use, or it can be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or frozen for longer storage.

### Chef's Notes
- The key to a rich and flavorful demi-glace is patience. The slow reduction process allows the flavors to concentrate and develop complexity.
- Demi-glace can be used as a base for many classic French sauces, such as Bordelaise and Madeira, or served as is to enhance the flavor of dishes like steak, lamb, and veal.
- For a clearer sauce, you can clarify the demi-glace using egg whites.
