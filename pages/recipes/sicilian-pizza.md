# Sicilian Pizza

Sicilian Pizza, also known as "Sfincione," is a traditional Italian dish originating from Sicily. Characterized by its thick, spongy crust and robust toppings, this pizza is a staple of Sicilian cuisine. Unlike its Neapolitan counterpart, Sicilian pizza is typically rectangular and boasts a hearty crust that can support a generous amount of toppings. This recipe focuses on a classic version featuring tomato, onions, anchovies, herbs, and a blend of cheeses.

- **Origin**: Sicily, Italy
- **Yield**: 1 large pizza
- **Portion Size**: 8 servings

## Ingredients

### For the Dough:
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup warm water (around 110°F)
- 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing
- 1 teaspoon salt

### For the Topping:
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 4 anchovy fillets, chopped (optional)
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparing the Dough:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy.
2. Add the flour, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough begins to form.
3. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.
4. Grease a large bowl with olive oil, place the dough inside, and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.

### Preparing the Toppings:
1. While the dough is rising, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until they are soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Set aside.
2. In a small bowl, mix the tomato sauce with oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.

### Assembling and Baking the Pizza:
1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven as it preheats.
2. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer the dough to a greased 13x9-inch baking sheet, stretching it to fit the pan.
3. Spread the seasoned tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
4. Distribute the sautéed onions, chopped anchovies (if using), and red pepper flakes (if using) over the sauce.
5. Sprinkle both the pecorino and mozzarella cheeses evenly over the top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.
7. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before cutting into squares and serving.

### Chef's Notes:
- For an authentic Sicilian experience, some bakers add breadcrumbs to the top of the pizza for added texture.
- The dough can also be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come to room temperature before stretching it into the pan.
