# Gravadlax

Gravadlax, also known as gravlax, is a Nordic dish consisting of raw salmon, cured in salt, sugar, and dill. This dish has its origins in Sweden and Norway, where it was traditionally buried in the sand near the ocean as a method of fermentation. Today, gravadlax is a popular delicacy across Scandinavia, served as an appetizer or on open-faced sandwiches, often accompanied by a mustard-dill sauce known as hovmästarsås.

- **Origin**: Scandinavia (Sweden/Norway)
- **Yield**: Serves 8-10
- **Portion Size**: 2-3 slices per person

## Ingredients

- 1 kg fresh salmon fillet, skin on, bones removed
- 100 g coarse sea salt
- 70 g sugar
- 2 tablespoons crushed white peppercorns
- 1 large bunch of dill, roughly chopped

### For the Mustard-Dill Sauce (Hovmästarsås)
- 4 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 200 ml vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- Salt and white pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Salmon**: Start by checking the salmon fillet for any remaining bones. Mix the coarse sea salt, sugar, and crushed white peppercorns in a bowl. Spread a layer of this mixture on a dish that is large enough to hold the salmon.

2. **Curing the Salmon**: Place half of the chopped dill on the salt and sugar mixture. Lay the salmon fillet, skin side down, on top. Cover the flesh side of the salmon with the remaining salt mixture and then top with the rest of the dill. Cover the salmon with plastic wrap, and place a small board or plate on top. Weigh it down with something heavy, like canned goods or a brick.

3. **Refrigeration**: Refrigerate the salmon for 24-36 hours, turning it every 12 hours and basting it with the liquid that accumulates.

4. **Slicing the Gravadlax**: After the curing time, remove the salmon from the refrigerator. Scrape off the dill and seasoning. Some prefer to rinse the salmon lightly under cold water; however, this is optional. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, slice the gravadlax thinly at an angle, away from the skin.

5. **Preparing the Mustard-Dill Sauce (Hovmästarsås)**: In a bowl, whisk together the Dijon mustard, sugar, and white wine vinegar until the sugar is dissolved. Gradually add the vegetable oil, whisking continuously until the sauce thickens. Stir in the chopped dill, and season with salt and white pepper to taste.

6. **Serving**: Arrange the gravadlax slices on a platter. Serve with the mustard-dill sauce on the side. Gravadlax can be enjoyed on rye bread, with boiled potatoes, or simply on its own.

## Chef's Notes

- The quality of the salmon is paramount for gravadlax. Opt for fresh, high-quality salmon from a trusted source.
- The curing time can be adjusted based on personal preference. A shorter cure will result in a softer texture and milder flavor, while a longer cure will yield a firmer texture and more pronounced flavor.
- Gravadlax can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week. Ensure it is tightly wrapped to maintain freshness.
- For an authentic Scandinavian experience, serve gravadlax as part of a smörgåsbord with other traditional dishes such as pickled herring, boiled potatoes, and rye bread.
