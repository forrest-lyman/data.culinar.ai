- **Origin**: Italy
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 200g per person

## Ingredients

### For the Seafood and Vegetables:
- 200g calamari, cleaned and cut into rings
- 200g large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 150g white fish fillets (such as cod or haddock), cut into bite-sized pieces
- 100g zucchini, sliced into thin rounds
- 100g eggplant, sliced into thin rounds
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Vegetable oil, for frying

### For the Batter:
- 200g all-purpose flour
- 300ml sparkling water, chilled
- 1 teaspoon salt
- A pinch of baking powder

## Instructions

### Preparing the Ingredients:
1. Season the seafood and vegetables with salt and pepper. Set them aside on a paper towel to absorb any excess moisture.
2. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a deep fryer with vegetable oil to 180°C (350°F). Ensure there is enough oil to completely submerge the items, but do not fill the pot more than halfway to prevent overflow.

### Making the Batter:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
2. Gradually add the chilled sparkling water to the dry ingredients, whisking continuously until the batter is smooth and has the consistency of heavy cream. Avoid overmixing to ensure the batter stays light and airy.

### Frying:
1. Dip the seafood and vegetables into the batter, shaking off any excess.
2. Carefully lower the battered items into the hot oil in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry until golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes for the seafood and 3-4 minutes for the vegetables.
3. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried items to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.
4. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and a sprinkle of sea salt.

## Chef's Notes:
- The key to a light and crispy Fritto Misto is the temperature of the oil and the batter. Ensure the oil is at the correct temperature before frying, and use chilled sparkling water for the batter to create a light, airy texture.
- Feel free to vary the seafood and vegetables based on availability and preference. Traditional variations might include small whole fish, like sardines, or other vegetables like bell peppers and mushrooms.
- Serving with aioli or marinara sauce can add an extra layer of flavor to the dish.
