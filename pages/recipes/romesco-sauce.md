# Romesco Sauce

Romesco sauce is a vibrant, nutty blend originating from Catalonia, Spain. Traditionally served with fish, this versatile sauce pairs well with grilled vegetables, meats, and as a spread for sandwiches. Its rich flavor profile comes from roasted red peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and almonds, creating a perfect balance of smoky, tangy, and slightly sweet notes.

- **Origin**: Catalonia, Spain
- **Yield**: About 2 cups
- **Portion Size**: 2 tablespoons

## Ingredients

- 2 large roasted red bell peppers, peeled and seeded
- 1 medium tomato, roasted and peeled
- 1/2 cup blanched almonds (or hazelnuts, or a mix of both)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
- 1 slice of crusty bread, toasted and torn into pieces
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- Salt, to taste

### Optional Garnish
- Chopped parsley
- A drizzle of olive oil

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Ingredients**: Ensure the roasted red peppers and tomato are well-drained to remove any excess liquid. Toast the almonds (or hazelnuts) lightly in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes. Let them cool before use.

2. **Blend the Base**: In a food processor or blender, combine the roasted red peppers, tomato, toasted almonds (or hazelnuts), garlic, olive oil, sherry vinegar, toasted bread, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper. Blend until the mixture is fairly smooth, with a bit of texture remaining from the nuts. Season with salt to taste.

3. **Adjust Consistency and Flavor**: If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little water or more olive oil to reach your desired consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, cayenne pepper, or vinegar as needed.

4. **Serve or Store**: Serve the romesco sauce immediately, garnished with chopped parsley and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired. Alternatively, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to one week. The flavors will continue to meld and develop over time.

### Chef's Notes
- For a smokier flavor, you can add a bit of chipotle pepper or additional smoked paprika.
- Romesco sauce can also be used as a marinade for meats or as a unique dressing for salads.
- If using hazelnuts, be sure to remove their skins after toasting by rubbing them in a clean kitchen towel, as the skins can be bitter.
