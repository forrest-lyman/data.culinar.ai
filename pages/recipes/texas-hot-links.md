# Texas Hot Links

Texas Hot Links, a staple of Texan barbecue, are spicy, smoky sausages known for their robust flavor and juicy texture. Originating from the German and Czech traditions brought to Central Texas by immigrants, these sausages have been adapted to include local spices and cooking methods, making them a unique feature of Texan cuisine. They are typically made from a combination of beef and pork, heavily seasoned, and smoked to perfection.

- **Origin**: Texas, USA
- **Yield**: 10 servings
- **Portion Size**: 2 links per serving

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs ground beef (20% fat)
- 1 lb ground pork
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (adjust for heat preference)
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- Natural hog casings, soaked in water and rinsed

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of the Meat Mixture**:
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef and ground pork. Mix gently to avoid toughening the meat.
   - In a separate bowl, mix together the apple cider vinegar and water. Add this liquid mixture to the meat, followed by all the spices (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, kosher salt, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes). Mix thoroughly to ensure the spices are evenly distributed throughout the meat.

2. **Stuffing the Casings**:
   - Prepare the hog casings by sliding one end onto the sausage stuffer's nozzle. Slowly feed the meat mixture into the stuffer and begin filling the casing, being careful to avoid air pockets. Do not overstuff; leave some room for the mixture to expand.
   - Once the casing is filled to your desired length, twist the sausage at regular intervals to form links. You can make them as long or as short as you prefer.

3. **Smoking the Sausages**:
   - Preheat your smoker to 225째F (107째C). Place the sausages on the smoker racks, ensuring they are not touching each other for even cooking.
   - Smoke the sausages for about 3 to 4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160째F (71째C). Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness.

4. **Serving**:
   - Allow the sausages to rest for 10 minutes before serving. This helps in redistributing the juices within the sausage.
   - Serve the Texas Hot Links on their own or with your choice of sides. Traditional accompaniments include barbecue sauce, coleslaw, and pickles.

## Chef's Notes

- The key to a juicy sausage is the fat content; ensure your meat mixture is around 30% fat.
- For an authentic smoky flavor, use hickory or mesquite wood chips in your smoker.
- Texas Hot Links can be made ahead of time and frozen. To reheat, simply thaw and grill or bake until heated through.
