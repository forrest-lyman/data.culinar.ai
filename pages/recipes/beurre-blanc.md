# Beurre Blanc

Beurre blanc, literally translated from French as "white butter," is a classic, emulsified butter sauce that is rich and velvety, often served with fish, seafood, or vegetables. Originating from the Loire Valley in France during the early 20th century, this sauce is a staple in French cuisine. Its creation is often attributed to the chef Clémence Lefeuvre, who reportedly invented it by accident at her restaurant on the banks of the Loire River.

- **Origin**: France, Loire Valley
- **Yield**: Approximately 1 cup
- **Portion Size**: 2 tablespoons per serving

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup (60 ml) white wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots
- 1 bay leaf (optional)
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns (optional)
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) heavy cream (optional, for stability)
- 3/4 cup (170 grams) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Reduction**: In a small saucepan, combine the white wine vinegar, dry white wine, shallots, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and reduce it until there are about 2 tablespoons of liquid left. This concentrates the flavors and forms the base of your sauce.

2. **Straining**: Remove the saucepan from the heat. Strain the reduction through a fine sieve into a clean saucepan to remove the solids. Discard the solids. If using heavy cream, add it to the reduction at this point and bring the mixture to a simmer.

3. **Incorporating Butter**: Reduce the heat to low. Gradually add the chilled butter pieces to the saucepan, whisking constantly. It’s crucial to maintain a low heat to ensure the sauce emulsifies without separating. Continue to whisk until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency.

4. **Seasoning and Serving**: Season the beurre blanc with salt and white pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it with a little warm water. Serve immediately, as beurre blanc does not hold well and can separate if kept warm for too long.

## Chef's Notes

- The addition of heavy cream is not traditional but helps stabilize the emulsion, making the sauce less likely to separate. This is a useful technique for beginners or when the sauce needs to hold a bit longer before serving.
- Beurre blanc is best served fresh but can be gently reheated over very low heat while whisking constantly if necessary.
- For variations, consider infusing the reduction with different herbs or substituting the vinegar and wine with citrus juices for a beurre blanc with a twist.
