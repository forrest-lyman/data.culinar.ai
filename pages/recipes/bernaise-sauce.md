# Béarnaise Sauce

Béarnaise sauce is a classic French sauce, renowned for its rich, buttery flavor with a unique tarragon and shallot vinegar reduction. Originating from the Béarn region of France, this sauce is a derivative of the mother sauce Hollandaise and is traditionally served with steak, though it pairs well with fish, eggs, and vegetables.

- **Origin**: France
- **Yield**: About 1 cup
- **Portion Size**: 2 tablespoons

## Ingredients

### For the Reduction
- 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons minced shallots
- 1 teaspoon dried tarragon
- 1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 1 bay leaf

### For the Sauce
- 3 large egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and kept warm
- 1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, finely chopped
- Salt and white pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Reduction
1. Combine the white wine vinegar, white wine, shallots, dried tarragon, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a small saucepan over medium heat.
2. Bring the mixture to a simmer and reduce it until there are about 2 tablespoons of liquid left. Strain the reduction through a fine sieve into a small bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.

### Sauce
1. In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of water until the mixture is light and frothy.
2. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method), ensuring the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Whisk the egg mixture vigorously until it becomes thick and pale, about 2-3 minutes.
3. Remove the bowl from the heat and slowly whisk in the melted butter, a few tablespoons at a time, until the sauce is thick and emulsified. If the sauce becomes too thick, a few drops of warm water can be whisked in to adjust the consistency.
4. Stir in the strained reduction and the fresh tarragon. Season with salt and white pepper to taste.
5. Serve immediately or keep the sauce warm over a pot of warm water until ready to serve.

### Chef's Notes
- Béarnaise sauce requires constant attention while whisking to prevent the eggs from scrambling. A double boiler setup is crucial for gentle heat.
- Fresh tarragon is preferred for its more pronounced flavor, but dried tarragon can be used in the reduction if fresh is not available.
- For a smoother sauce, strain the finished sauce through a fine sieve to remove any possible curdled egg bits.
