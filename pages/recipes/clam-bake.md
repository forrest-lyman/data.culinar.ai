# New England Clam Bake

A traditional New England Clam Bake is a method of cooking seafood, often with vegetables, in a pit dug in the beach sand, heated with hot stones. This method creates a steam oven. Originating from the Native Americans and adopted by the settlers in the New England region of the United States, it's a festive and communal outdoor cooking tradition, especially popular in the summer months.

- **Origin**: New England, USA
- **Yield**: Serves 8
- **Portion Size**: 1 generous plate per person

## Ingredients

- 4 pounds of small, hard-shell clams (like littlenecks), scrubbed
- 2 pounds of mussels, scrubbed and debearded
- 2 pounds of large shrimp, in the shell
- 8 ears of corn, husked and halved
- 2 pounds of small red potatoes, scrubbed
- 2 large onions, peeled and quartered
- 4 live lobsters (about 1-1.5 pounds each)
- 2 cups of dry white wine
- 4 cups of water
- 1/2 cup of seaweed (optional, if available)
- 2 lemons, cut into wedges
- Melted butter for serving
- Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Preparation**: If you're not on a beach with a fire pit, you can use a large, heavy-duty roasting pan or a large stockpot. Line the bottom with rocks or a metal rack to keep the ingredients from direct heat.

2. **Layering**: Start by placing the potatoes, onions, and corn at the bottom of the pan or pot. These ingredients take the longest to cook.

3. **Adding Seafood**: Place the lobsters on top of the vegetables, then add the clams, mussels, and shrimp. If using seaweed, layer it between the seafood for an authentic ocean flavor.

4. **Cooking Liquid**: Pour the white wine and water over the ingredients. The liquid will steam and cook the food.

5. **Covering**: Seal the pot or pan tightly with a lid or heavy-duty aluminum foil. This will trap the steam and cook the food.

6. **Cooking**: Place the pot over a medium-high heat source. If you're outdoors, a grill or a fire pit works well. Cook for about 40 to 50 minutes. The bake is done when the potatoes are tender, and the clams and mussels have opened.

7. **Serving**: Carefully remove the cover to avoid the steam. Serve the clam bake on a large platter or simply spread out over newspapers for a rustic feel. Provide melted butter and lemon wedges on the side. Garnish with fresh parsley.

## Chef's Notes

- It's crucial to discard any clams or mussels that haven't opened after cooking, as they might not be safe to eat.
- The traditional clam bake is a communal and festive meal, often enjoyed outdoors. Adaptations can be made for indoor cooking, but the essence of gathering and sharing remains central to the experience.
- Seaweed, when available, adds an authentic ocean flavor and helps to steam the seafood, but it can be omitted if not accessible.
