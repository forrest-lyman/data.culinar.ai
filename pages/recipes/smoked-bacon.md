- **Origin**: Europe
- **Yield**: Approximately 2-3 pounds
- **Portion Size**: Varies

## Ingredients

### For the Cure
- 2 pounds of pork belly, skin on or off based on preference
- 2 tablespoons of kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons of pink curing salt (Prague Powder #1)
- 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons of black pepper, coarsely ground
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of maple syrup (optional for a sweeter flavor)

### For Smoking
- Wood chips (hickory, applewood, or cherry are recommended), soaked in water for at least 1 hour

## Instructions

### Preparing the Cure
1. In a small bowl, mix together the kosher salt, pink curing salt, brown sugar, black pepper, and minced garlic to create the cure mixture.
2. If using, incorporate the maple syrup into the cure mixture, ensuring it is well combined.
3. Place the pork belly in a large resealable plastic bag or a non-reactive container.
4. Rub the cure mixture all over the pork belly, making sure every part is covered.
5. Seal the bag or cover the container and place it in the refrigerator. Allow the pork belly to cure for 7 days, flipping it once a day to ensure even curing.

### Preparing for Smoking
1. After the curing period, remove the pork belly from the refrigerator. Rinse it thoroughly under cold water to remove the cure.
2. Pat the pork belly dry with paper towels, then let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours to form a pellicle (a sticky surface layer that helps the smoke adhere).
3. Preheat your smoker to 200째F (93째C). Drain the wood chips and place them in the smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### Smoking the Bacon
1. Place the pork belly in the smoker. Smoke until the internal temperature reaches 150째F (65째C), which should take about 2-3 hours depending on the thickness of the pork belly.
2. Once smoked, remove the bacon from the smoker and let it cool to room temperature. Then, wrap it tightly in butcher paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. This step helps the flavors to meld and the bacon to firm up, making it easier to slice.

### Serving
1. Slice the bacon to your desired thickness. For best results, use a sharp knife or a meat slicer.
2. Cook the sliced bacon in a skillet over medium heat until it reaches your preferred level of crispiness.
3. Serve immediately as part of your favorite dishes or enjoy it on its own.

## Chef's Notes
- The use of pink curing salt (Prague Powder #1) is crucial for preventing the growth of bacteria during the curing process. It also contributes to the bacon's pink color and distinctive flavor.
- The curing time can be adjusted based on the thickness of the pork belly and personal preference. A longer cure will result in a saltier, more intensely flavored bacon.
- Experiment with different types of wood chips to find your preferred smoke flavor. Each type of wood imparts a unique taste to the bacon.
