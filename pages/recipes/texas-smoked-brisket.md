# Texas Smoked Brisket

Texas Smoked Brisket is a quintessential dish in American barbecue, particularly celebrated in the state of Texas. Known for its tender, flavorful meat and smoky aroma, this dish is a staple at gatherings and a testament to the art of slow cooking. Originating from the Southern United States, it showcases the tradition of smoking meat over low heat for several hours.

- **Origin**: Texas, United States
- **Yield**: Serves 8-10
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 8-10 ounces per person

## Ingredients

- 1 whole brisket (10-12 pounds), with fat cap trimmed to 1/4 inch
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- 1/4 cup black pepper, freshly ground
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- Optional: 1 tablespoon paprika for color

## Instructions

1. **Preparation**: The night before you plan to smoke the brisket, prepare your dry rub by mixing the kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and optional paprika in a bowl. Apply the rub generously over the entire surface of the brisket, ensuring both the meat and fat cap are well-coated. Wrap the brisket in butcher paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

2. **Preheat Your Smoker**: On the day of cooking, preheat your smoker to a steady temperature of 225°F (107°C). Use oak or hickory wood for an authentic Texas flavor.

3. **Smoke the Brisket**: Place the brisket fat side up on the smoker's grate. Close the lid and smoke the meat, maintaining a consistent temperature of 225°F (107°C). The general rule of thumb is to smoke the brisket for 1 to 1.5 hours per pound. However, the key to perfect brisket is cooking to temperature, not time. Aim for an internal temperature of 195°F (90°C) to 205°F (96°C) for optimal tenderness.

4. **Wrap the Brisket**: Once the brisket reaches an internal temperature of around 165°F (74°C), wrap it in butcher paper or aluminum foil. This step is optional but helps to retain moisture and accelerate the cooking process.

5. **Finish Cooking**: Continue to cook the brisket until it reaches the desired internal temperature. The meat should be probe-tender, meaning a probe or skewer slides into the meat with little resistance.

6. **Rest the Brisket**: Remove the brisket from the smoker and let it rest for at least 1 hour before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring it's moist and tender.

7. **Slice and Serve**: Slice the brisket against the grain into thin slices. Serve immediately with your choice of sides, such as coleslaw, baked beans, or potato salad.

## Chef's Notes

- The brisket's fat cap helps to keep the meat moist during the long smoking process. While it's important to trim the fat cap to about 1/4 inch, leaving some fat is crucial for flavor and moisture.
- The stall, a period where the brisket's internal temperature plateaus, is a common occurrence. Wrapping the brisket can help overcome this phase.
- Resting the brisket is as important as the cooking process itself. It allows the meat to relax and reabsorb its juices, making it more tender and flavorful.
- For a more authentic Texas experience, consider serving the brisket with sliced white bread, pickles, and onions.
