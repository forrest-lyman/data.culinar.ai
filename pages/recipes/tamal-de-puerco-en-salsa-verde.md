# Tamal de Puerco en Salsa Verde

Tamal de Puerco en Salsa Verde is a traditional Mexican dish that consists of a corn dough (masa) filled with pork in a green salsa, all wrapped in corn husks and steamed until cooked. This dish is deeply rooted in Mexican culture, often prepared for special occasions and family gatherings. The combination of the savory pork filling and the slightly sweet masa creates a delightful contrast, while the green salsa adds a fresh and slightly spicy flavor.

- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: 20 tamales
- **Portion Size**: 1 tamal

## Ingredients

### For the Salsa Verde:
- 1 lb (450g) tomatillos, husked and rinsed
- 2-3 serrano peppers, stems removed (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- 1/2 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic
- Salt to taste

### For the Pork Filling:
- 2 lbs (900g) pork shoulder, cut into large chunks
- 1 medium onion, quartered
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Water, enough to cover the pork

### For the Masa:
- 4 cups (500g) masa harina
- 1 1/2 cups (355ml) pork broth (from cooking the pork)
- 1 cup (240ml) lard or vegetable shortening, melted
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Additional:
- 20 corn husks, soaked in warm water for at least an hour

## Instructions

### Preparing the Salsa Verde:
1. In a pot, combine tomatillos and serrano peppers. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes or until tomatillos are soft.
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatillos and peppers to a blender. Add cilantro, onion, garlic, and salt. Blend until smooth. Set aside.

### Cooking the Pork:
1. Place pork chunks in a large pot with onion, garlic, and salt. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 2 hours or until pork is tender.
2. Remove pork from the broth, reserving the broth for the masa. Shred the pork and mix it with the prepared salsa verde. Set aside.

### Preparing the Masa:
1. In a large bowl, mix masa harina, pork broth, melted lard, baking powder, and salt. Knead until the mixture is smooth and homogenous. If the dough feels dry, add more broth or water until it reaches a spreadable consistency.

### Assembling the Tamales:
1. Drain the corn husks and pat them dry. Spread about 2 tablespoons of masa on the wider end of each husk, leaving a border around the edges.
2. Place a spoonful of the pork in salsa verde mixture in the center of the masa.
3. Fold the sides of the husks in over the filling, then fold the bottom of the husk up. Tie with a strip of corn husk or string if necessary.
4. Repeat with the remaining husks, masa, and filling.

### Steaming the Tamales:
1. Arrange the tamales standing up in a steamer basket. Cover with a damp cloth and the steamer lid.
2. Steam over medium heat for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the masa separates easily from the husks.
3. Let the tamales rest for a few minutes before serving.

> **Chef's Notes:**
> - Soaking the corn husks in warm water makes them more pliable and easier to fold.
> - The pork can be cooked a day ahead to save time on the day of assembly.
> - Tamales can be frozen before steaming for later use. Simply thaw and steam when ready to enjoy.
