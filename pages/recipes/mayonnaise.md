# Classic Homemade Mayonnaise

Mayonnaise is a staple condiment in many cuisines around the world, known for its creamy texture and versatile flavor. Originating from France, this emulsion of egg yolks, oil, and an acid (usually vinegar or lemon juice) can be used as a base for numerous sauces and dressings or simply spread on sandwiches and burgers. Making mayonnaise at home allows for customization of flavor and ensures a fresh, preservative-free product.

- **Origin**: France
- **Yield**: Approximately 1 cup
- **Portion Size**: 1 tablespoon

## Ingredients

- 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice or white wine vinegar
- 1 cup (240 ml) neutral oil (e.g., canola, sunflower, or light olive oil)
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste (optional)

### For Variation (Optional)
- 1 clove garlic, minced (for aioli)
- 1 tablespoon fresh herbs, finely chopped (e.g., dill, tarragon, parsley)
- 1 tablespoon capers, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Base**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice or vinegar until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly thickened. This forms the base of the mayonnaise.

2. **Emulsification Process**: Begin adding the oil very slowly, starting with a few drops at a time while continuously whisking. As the mixture begins to thicken, you can gradually increase the oil flow to a thin, steady stream. It's crucial to add the oil slowly to ensure the mixture emulsifies properly and achieves the desired creamy texture.

3. **Seasoning**: Once all the oil has been incorporated and the mayonnaise has thickened, season with salt and, if using, white pepper to taste. Adjust the acidity if necessary by adding a little more lemon juice or vinegar.

4. **Optional Variations**: For aioli, whisk in the minced garlic at the end. For a herb mayonnaise, fold in the finely chopped herbs. For a caper mayonnaise, stir in the chopped capers. Each variation can add a unique flavor profile to the basic mayonnaise recipe.

5. **Storage**: Transfer the mayonnaise to a clean jar or container and refrigerate. Homemade mayonnaise should be used within 3 to 4 days for best quality and safety.

### Chef's Notes

- Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature to help the emulsion process.
- If the mayonnaise breaks (the emulsion separates), you can attempt to rescue it by whisking a fresh egg yolk in a clean bowl and slowly whisking the broken mayonnaise into the yolk.
- For a lighter version, a mixture of half olive oil and half neutral oil can be used, but using all olive oil can make the mayonnaise too strong for some tastes.
