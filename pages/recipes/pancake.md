# Classic Pancakes

Pancakes are a versatile and beloved dish enjoyed across the globe. Originating from ancient Greece, pancakes have evolved into various forms depending on the region. This recipe focuses on the classic American-style pancake, known for its fluffy and light texture. Perfect for breakfast or brunch, these pancakes can be served with a variety of toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, or whipped cream.

- **Origin:** United States
- **Yield:** 8 pancakes
- **Portion Size:** 1 pancake

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons melted butter
- Additional butter or oil for cooking

### For Serving (Optional)

- Maple syrup
- Fresh berries
- Whipped cream

## Instructions

### Batter Preparation

1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Make a well in the center.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg lightly and then mix in the milk and melted butter.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the well of the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. It's important not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.

### Cooking the Pancakes

1. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can test if the pan is ready by sprinkling a few drops of water on it; if they dance and evaporate, the pan is hot enough.
2. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Spread the batter slightly to form circles.
3. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, about 1-2 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, approximately 1 minute more.
4. Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat as necessary. Serve hot with your choice of toppings.

### Chef's Notes

- For an extra fluffy texture, separate the egg. Add the yolk to the milk and butter mixture as directed, but beat the egg white until stiff peaks form and fold it into the batter last.
- If you prefer thinner pancakes, you can add more milk to the batter to achieve your desired consistency.
- Experiment with add-ins like blueberries, chocolate chips, or nuts by gently folding them into the batter just before cooking.
