# Esquites (Mexican Corn Salad)

Esquites, also known as Mexican corn salad, is a popular street food in Mexico, derived from the ancient culinary traditions of the Aztecs. This dish is a flavorful combination of corn kernels, mayonnaise, cotija cheese, lime, and chili powder, offering a perfect balance of creamy, tangy, and spicy tastes. It's typically served in cups and enjoyed with a spoon, making it a convenient and delicious snack or side dish.

- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 cup per serving

## Ingredients

- 4 cups corn kernels (fresh from about 4-5 ears of corn, or frozen and thawed)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup cotija cheese, crumbled, plus more for garnish
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 1-2 limes)
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, plus more for garnish
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped (optional)
- Salt to taste

### For Garnish
- Lime wedges
- Additional crumbled cotija cheese
- A sprinkle of chili powder
- Chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Corn**: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are charred and golden brown, about 10 minutes. If using frozen corn, ensure it's well-drained and dry to achieve the best char.

2. **Mix the Dressing**: In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, 1/4 cup cotija cheese, lime juice, chili powder, and chopped cilantro. If you're using jalapeño for a spicy kick, mix it in at this stage. Stir until well combined.

3. **Combine and Serve**: Add the cooked corn to the dressing in the bowl while the corn is still warm. This helps the flavors meld together beautifully. Mix well until all the corn is coated with the dressing. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, if necessary.

4. **Garnish and Enjoy**: Serve the esquites in cups or a serving bowl. Garnish with additional cotija cheese, a sprinkle of chili powder, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges on the side.

### Chef's Notes:
- For an authentic touch, char the corn on a grill before cutting off the kernels. This adds a smoky flavor that's traditional in esquites.
- Esquites can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold, making it a versatile dish for any season.
- If cotija cheese is unavailable, feta cheese can be a suitable substitute, offering a similar briny flavor.
