- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: 12 servings
- **Portion Size**: 1 tamal

## Ingredients

### For the Dough (Masa)
- 4 cups masa harina
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 cup lard or vegetable shortening, room temperature
- 2 1/2 cups chicken or beef broth, warm
- 1/4 cup red salsa (from the salsa ingredients below)

### For the Filling
- 2 lbs beef chuck, cut into large chunks
- 1 large onion, quartered
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 bay leaves
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### For the Salsa
- 4 large tomatoes, charred
- 4 dried guajillo chiles, deseeded and soaked in hot water
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 small onion, roughly chopped
- Salt, to taste

### Additional
- 24 corn husks, soaked in warm water for at least an hour

## Instructions

### Prepare the Filling
1. In a large pot, combine beef chunks, quartered onion, garlic cloves, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Add water to cover by an inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beef is tender and easily shredded.
2. Remove the beef from the broth, reserve the broth for the dough, and shred the beef. Set aside.

### Make the Salsa
1. Blend the charred tomatoes, soaked guajillo chiles, garlic, and onion until smooth. Season with salt to taste.
2. In a saucepan, cook the salsa over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until it thickens slightly. Let it cool.
3. Mix the shredded beef with half of the salsa. Reserve the other half for the dough and serving.

### Prepare the Dough
1. In a large bowl, mix masa harina, baking powder, and salt. Add the lard or shortening, and mix until crumbly.
2. Gradually add the warm broth and 1/4 cup of the prepared salsa, mixing until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add more broth as needed. The dough should be spreadable but not too sticky.

### Assemble the Tamales
1. Drain the corn husks and pat dry. Spread about 2 tablespoons of dough onto the center of each husk, leaving a border around the edges.
2. Add a spoonful of the beef filling in the center of the dough.
3. Fold the sides of the husks in over the filling, then fold the bottom up. Tie with a strip of corn husk or string if necessary.
4. Steam the tamales for about 90 minutes, or until the dough is firm and pulls away from the husk easily.

### Serving
Serve the tamales hot, with the remaining salsa on the side.

## Chef's Notes
- The key to flavorful tamales is in the salsa and the dough. Don't hesitate to adjust the seasoning as per your taste.
- Tamales can be frozen before steaming. To cook, simply steam for an additional 30 minutes.
