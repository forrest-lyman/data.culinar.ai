# Classic French Baguette

The baguette, a symbol of French cuisine, is known for its crispy crust and soft, airy interior. Originating from France, this elongated bread is versatile, serving as the perfect accompaniment to meals or as the base for sandwiches. The process of making a baguette involves precise techniques to achieve its characteristic texture and flavor.

- **Origin**: France
- **Yield**: 2 Baguettes
- **Portion Size**: 1 Baguette

## Ingredients

- 500g (4 cups) bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 10g (2 tsp) salt
- 7g (1 packet) instant yeast
- 350ml (1 ½ cups) warm water
- Cornmeal, for dusting

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, salt, and instant yeast. Gradually add the warm water, mixing until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.

2. **First Rise**: Lightly oil a clean bowl and place the dough inside, covering it with a damp cloth. Let it rise in a warm, draft-free area for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.

3. **Shape the Baguettes**: Gently deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Roll and stretch each piece into a long, thin shape, approximately 14 inches in length. Place the shaped dough onto a baking tray dusted with cornmeal to prevent sticking. Cover with a damp cloth and let them rise again for about 30 minutes, or until puffy.

4. **Preheat the Oven**: While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 240°C (475°F). Place a baking stone or an inverted baking tray in the oven to heat. Additionally, place a shallow metal or cast-iron pan on the bottom rack of the oven.

5. **Score and Bake**: Just before baking, make several diagonal slashes on the top of each baguette using a sharp knife or a lame. This allows the bread to expand properly during baking. Transfer the baguettes onto the preheated baking stone or tray. Pour a cup of hot water into the shallow pan to create steam, and quickly close the oven door. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the baguettes are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.

6. **Cooling**: Remove the baguettes from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing. This allows the crust to develop fully.

## Chef's Notes

- **Hydration**: The dough for baguettes is relatively wet compared to other bread doughs. This hydration is key to achieving the open, airy crumb characteristic of a good baguette.
- **Scoring**: The technique of scoring the dough just before baking is not only for aesthetics. It helps control the direction in which the bread expands during baking.
- **Steam**: Introducing steam into the oven during the initial phase of baking is crucial for achieving the baguette's signature crispy crust. The steam delays crust formation, allowing the bread to expand fully and develop a shiny, crackly crust.

Enjoy your homemade French baguette as a side to your favorite meals, or use it to create delicious sandwiches. Bon appétit!
