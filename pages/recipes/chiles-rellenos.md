# Chiles Rellenos

Chiles Rellenos, translating to "stuffed peppers," is a traditional Mexican dish that consists of roasted poblano peppers filled with cheese (or sometimes meat) and then covered in an egg batter and fried until golden brown. Originating from the cuisine of Puebla, Mexico, this dish beautifully showcases the rich and complex flavors of Mexican culinary traditions.

- **Origin**: Mexico, specifically Puebla
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: 2 Chiles Rellenos per person

## Ingredients

- 8 poblano peppers
- 2 cups of Oaxaca cheese or mozzarella, shredded
- 4 eggs, separated
- 1 cup all-purpose flour, for dusting
- 2 cups of vegetable oil, for frying
- Salt, to taste

### For the Tomato Sauce:
- 4 large tomatoes, chopped
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Roast the Poblano Peppers**: Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet under a broiler or directly over an open flame on a gas stove. Turn them occasionally until the skins are blackened and blistered all over. Transfer the roasted peppers into a plastic bag and let them steam for about 10 minutes. This process will make peeling the peppers easier.

2. **Peel and Prepare the Peppers**: After steaming, gently peel the blackened skin off the peppers. Make a slit down one side of each pepper and carefully remove the seeds and membranes, trying not to tear the peppers. Leave the stems intact.

3. **Stuff the Peppers**: Stuff each pepper with an equal amount of cheese, then close the slit, and secure it with toothpicks if necessary.

4. **Prepare the Egg Batter**: In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in the egg yolks until just combined.

5. **Dredge and Fry**: Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Dust the stuffed peppers with flour, shaking off the excess. Dip each pepper into the egg mixture to coat thoroughly, then fry in the hot oil. Cook until they are golden brown on all sides. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.

6. **Prepare the Tomato Sauce**: In a saucepan over medium heat, cook the tomatoes, onion, and garlic until softened. Add oregano, salt, and pepper. Blend the mixture until smooth and simmer for an additional 10 minutes.

7. **Serve**: Place the fried chiles rellenos on a serving plate and pour the warm tomato sauce over them. Serve immediately.

### Chef's Notes:
- For a variation, you can add cooked ground meat, such as beef or pork, to the cheese stuffing for a heartier filling.
- It's important to beat the egg whites to stiff peaks to ensure the batter is light and crispy.
