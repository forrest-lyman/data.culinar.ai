# Sopa de Lima (Mexican Lime Soup)

Sopa de Lima is a traditional Mexican soup hailing from the Yucatan Peninsula, known for its tangy and refreshing flavor profile. This dish beautifully combines the tartness of lime with the richness of chicken broth and the aromatic spices typical of Yucatecan cuisine. It's a comforting yet light soup, perfect for any season.

**Origin:** Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula)

**Yield:** Serves 4

**Portion Size:** Approximately 1.5 cups

## Ingredients

- **For the Soup:**
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 medium white onion, finely chopped
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 bell pepper (red or green), diced
  - 1 jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped (optional for heat)
  - 4 cups chicken broth
  - 2 cups water
  - 1 pound chicken breast, boneless and skinless
  - Salt and pepper, to taste
  - 1 teaspoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 3/4 cup fresh lime juice (about 6 limes)
  - 1 tablespoon lime zest

- **For Serving:**
  - 1 avocado, diced
  - Fresh cilantro, chopped
  - Tortilla strips or chips
  - Additional lime wedges

## Instructions

### Preparing the Soup Base

1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, bell pepper, and jalapeño (if using). Sauté until the vegetables are soft and the onions are translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
2. Pour in the chicken broth and water, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the chicken breast, salt, pepper, oregano, cumin, and cinnamon. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.

### Finishing the Soup

1. Remove the chicken breast from the pot and let it cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces.
2. Return the shredded chicken to the pot. Stir in the fresh lime juice and lime zest, and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

### Serving

1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Top each serving with diced avocado, a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, and tortilla strips. Serve with additional lime wedges on the side.

## Chef's Notes

- The key to Sopa de Lima's unique flavor is the use of fresh lime juice and zest. It's best to avoid bottled lime juice, as it lacks the vibrant flavor of fresh limes.
- For a more authentic touch, you can make your own tortilla strips by cutting corn tortillas into strips and frying them until crispy.
- This soup is traditionally not very spicy, but you can adjust the heat level by adding more jalapeño or serving it with a spicy salsa on the side.
