# Tamal de Dulce

Tamal de dulce, a sweet variation of the traditional savory tamal, is a cherished dessert in various parts of Latin America, particularly in Mexico. Unlike its savory counterpart, tamal de dulce is filled with sweetened ingredients, making it a delightful treat often enjoyed during celebrations, festivals, and particularly during the Day of the Dead and Las Posadas. This recipe embraces the essence of Mexican cuisine, offering a fusion of indigenous and Spanish influences through its use of corn dough and sweet fillings.

- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: 12 servings
- **Portion Size**: 1 tamal

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- 2 cups of masa harina (corn dough flour)
- 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup of granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon of baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1 cup of milk, warm

### For the Filling
- 1/2 cup of raisins
- 1/2 cup of shredded coconut
- 1/2 cup of chopped pecans
- 1/4 cup of candied cherries, chopped
- Zest of 1 orange

### Additional
- 24 corn husks, soaked in warm water for at least an hour

## Instructions

### Preparing the Corn Husks
1. Ensure the corn husks are thoroughly soaked in warm water for at least an hour before starting. This makes them pliable and easy to fold.

### Making the Dough
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, baking powder, and salt.
2. In another bowl, cream the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the warm milk, until a soft dough forms.
4. Cover the dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes at room temperature.

### Preparing the Filling
1. In a medium bowl, mix together the raisins, shredded coconut, chopped pecans, candied cherries, and orange zest.

### Assembling the Tamales
1. Take a corn husk and pat it dry. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough onto the center of the husk.
2. Sprinkle a generous tablespoon of the filling over the dough.
3. Fold the sides of the husk towards the center, then fold the bottom up. Tie with a strip of corn husk or string if necessary.
4. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough, and filling.

### Cooking the Tamales
1. Fill a large steamer with water and bring to a simmer. Arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer basket, with the open end up.
2. Cover with a damp cloth and then the lid. Steam for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the dough is firm and pulls away from the husk easily.
3. Let the tamales rest for a few minutes before serving.

## Chef's Notes
- Tamal de dulce can be customized with various fillings according to personal preference or seasonal availability. Popular variations include using different dried fruits, nuts, or even chocolate.
- The texture of the dough is crucial; it should be soft and spreadable but not runny. Adjust the amount of milk as necessary.
- These tamales can be made ahead and frozen for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply steam them again until thoroughly warmed.
