# Breakfast Sausage

Breakfast sausage is a staple in many cuisines around the world, known for its savory, spicy, and sometimes sweet flavors. Originating from various regions, each with its own unique blend of spices and herbs, breakfast sausage is a versatile ingredient that can be tailored to suit any palate. This recipe focuses on a classic American-style breakfast sausage, perfect for pairing with eggs, pancakes, or simply enjoyed on its own.

- **Origin**: United States
- **Yield**: 8 servings
- **Portion Size**: 2 sausages per serving

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (450g) ground pork
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 tsp sage, dried
- 1 tsp thyme, dried
- 1/4 tsp marjoram, dried
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg, freshly grated
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 tbsp ice water
- 1 tbsp olive oil (for cooking)

### Optional Ingredients

- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion powder

## Instructions

1. **Mix the Seasonings**: In a small bowl, combine salt, black pepper, sage, thyme, marjoram, red pepper flakes, nutmeg, and brown sugar. If using, also mix in the garlic powder and onion powder. This blend of spices will give your sausage its characteristic flavor.

2. **Combine with Pork**: Place the ground pork in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the mixed seasonings over the pork. Add the ice water to the mixture. The water helps to distribute the seasonings evenly and keeps the sausage moist during cooking.

3. **Mix Thoroughly**: Using your hands, mix the pork and seasonings together until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the sausage tough. Once mixed, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight. This resting period allows the flavors to meld together.

4. **Form the Sausages**: Remove the sausage mixture from the refrigerator. Wet your hands slightly with cold water to prevent sticking, and form the mixture into 16 small patties, about 2 inches in diameter.

5. **Cook the Sausages**: Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage patties. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked through and golden brown on the outside. Ensure the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) for safety.

6. **Serve**: Serve the breakfast sausages hot, alongside your favorite breakfast dishes.

### Chef's Notes

- For a leaner option, you can substitute ground turkey or chicken for the pork, though this may slightly alter the traditional flavor profile.
- Adjust the level of red pepper flakes to control the spiciness of the sausage according to your preference.
- These sausages can be cooked and then frozen. Reheat in a skillet or microwave for a quick and satisfying breakfast option.
