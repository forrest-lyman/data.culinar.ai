# Memphis-Style Dry Rub Ribs

Memphis, Tennessee, is renowned for its distinctive style of barbecue, particularly its ribs. Unlike other barbecue traditions that heavily rely on sauces, Memphis-style ribs are celebrated for their dry rub—a flavorful blend of spices that gives the meat its unique taste. These ribs are typically smoked, allowing the rub to form a crusty exterior, locking in the flavors and juices. This recipe pays homage to that tradition, offering a taste of Southern barbecue right from your home.

**Origin:** United States, specifically Memphis, Tennessee

**Yield:** Serves 4

**Portion Size:** 1 rack of ribs per 2 persons

### Ingredients:

- 2 racks of pork ribs (about 4-5 lbs)
- 1/4 cup paprika
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon dry mustard
- 2 teaspoons celery salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Instructions:

1. **Preparation of the Ribs:** Begin by removing the membrane from the back of each rack of ribs. Use a knife to gently lift the membrane, then grab it with a paper towel and pull it off. This step is crucial for ensuring the spices penetrate the meat.

2. **Making the Dry Rub:** In a bowl, combine paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ground black pepper, dried oregano, cayenne pepper, brown sugar, dry mustard, celery salt, ground cumin, and salt. Mix well to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.

3. **Applying the Rub:** Generously apply the dry rub to both sides of the ribs, ensuring a thorough coat. Gently massage the rub into the meat to enhance flavor absorption.

4. **Resting:** Allow the ribs to rest with the rub on them for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. For optimal flavor, consider letting them marinate overnight.

5. **Smoking the Ribs:** Preheat your smoker to 225°F (107°C). Place the ribs in the smoker, meaty side up, and smoke for about 4-5 hours, or until the meat is tender and pulls away from the bone. If you're using a grill, set it up for indirect cooking and follow the same temperature and time guidelines.

6. **Serving:** Once cooked, let the ribs rest for about 10 minutes before cutting into individual servings. Serve as is, allowing the dry rub to shine, or with a side of barbecue sauce for those who prefer a wetter rib.

### Chef's Notes:

- The key to Memphis-style ribs is the dry rub and slow cooking process. Resist the temptation to add sauce during the cooking process; this will ensure you get that authentic crusty exterior that's highly prized.
- For an authentic Memphis experience, serve with a side of coleslaw and cornbread.
