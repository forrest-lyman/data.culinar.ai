# Classic Marinara Sauce

A staple in Italian cuisine, Marinara Sauce is a vibrant, tomato-based sauce that originated in Naples, Italy. It is known for its simplicity and versatility, often used as a base for pasta, pizza, and numerous other dishes. This recipe yields a rich, flavorful sauce that celebrates the freshness of its ingredients.

- **Origin**: Naples, Italy
- **Yield**: Approximately 4 cups
- **Portion Size**: 1/2 cup

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)
- 2 cans (28 ounces each) whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- 1 large bay leaf
- 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
- 2 teaspoons fresh oregano, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried oregano)

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Ingredients**: Begin by preparing your ingredients. Finely chop the onion, mince the garlic, and if using whole peeled tomatoes, crush them by hand or with a potato masher for a more rustic texture.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics**: In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent and slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant.

3. **Add Tomatoes and Seasonings**: Stir in the crushed tomatoes, including their juice. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Add the bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

4. **Simmer the Sauce**: Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken slightly as it cooks.

5. **Final Seasonings and Herbs**: Remove the bay leaf. Stir in the chopped basil and oregano. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper if necessary.

6. **Serving**: Serve the marinara sauce hot over cooked pasta, as a dipping sauce, or as a base for other dishes. It can also be cooled and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

## Chef's Notes

- For a smoother sauce, you can blend the sauce using an immersion blender or a standard blender. Be cautious when blending hot liquids and allow the sauce to cool slightly before blending.
- The addition of sugar is optional and can be adjusted based on the acidity of the tomatoes. Some prefer a touch of sweetness to balance the flavors.
- Fresh herbs add a vibrant flavor to the sauce, but dried herbs can be used in their absence. If using dried, remember they have a more concentrated flavor, so use them sparingly.
- This sauce can serve as a foundation for many variations. Feel free to experiment by adding capers, olives, or cooked ground meat to tailor it to your taste preferences.
