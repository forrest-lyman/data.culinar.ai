# Classic Alfredo Sauce

Alfredo sauce is a rich, creamy sauce often served with pasta, originating from Rome, Italy. It combines butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese to create a luxurious coating for noodles, particularly fettuccine. This sauce has gained international popularity, especially in American-Italian cuisine, for its simplicity and decadent flavor profile.

- **Origin**: Italy
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1/2 cup per serving

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional: Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Melt the Butter**: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Be careful not to let it brown.

2. **Add Heavy Cream**: Slowly whisk in the heavy cream. Let the mixture come to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer gently for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

3. **Incorporate Parmesan**: Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese to the saucepan, stirring constantly until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. This process should take about 3-4 minutes.

4. **Season the Sauce**: Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. For an added depth of flavor, a small grating of fresh nutmeg can be included. Stir well to combine.

5. **Serve Immediately**: Alfredo sauce is best served immediately while it's hot and creamy. Toss it with cooked pasta, such as fettuccine, and serve. If the sauce thickens upon standing, you can thin it with a little pasta cooking water.

## Chef's Notes

- For the best flavor and texture, it's crucial to use freshly grated Parmesan cheese rather than pre-grated varieties, which may not melt as smoothly into the sauce.
- Alfredo sauce is traditionally served with fettuccine, but it pairs well with a variety of pasta shapes.
- This sauce can serve as a base; feel free to add cooked chicken, shrimp, or vegetables for a more substantial dish.
