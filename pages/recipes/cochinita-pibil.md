# Cochinita Pibil

Cochinita Pibil is a traditional Mexican slow-roasted pork dish from the Yucatán Peninsula. The uniqueness of this dish comes from its preparation and marination in achiote paste and citrus juices, then wrapped in banana leaves and slow-cooked until tender. This method infuses the meat with a distinctive earthy flavor and a vibrant reddish hue. It's commonly served with pickled red onions and tortillas.

**Origin:** Mexico (Yucatán Peninsula)

**Yield:** Serves 8

**Portion Size:** Approximately 4-6 ounces per person

## Ingredients

### For the Achiote Marinade:
- 1/2 cup achiote paste
- 1 cup orange juice, freshly squeezed
- 1/2 cup lime juice, freshly squeezed
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Pork:
- 5 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 2-3 banana leaves (optional, but recommended)
- Salt to taste

### For Serving:
- Pickled red onions
- Warm corn tortillas
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)
- Lime wedges

## Instructions

### Preparing the Marinade:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the achiote paste, orange juice, lime juice, white vinegar, minced garlic, cumin, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper until well combined.
2. Add the pork chunks to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.

### Preparing the Pork:
1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). If using a traditional pit or an outdoor grill, prepare for low, indirect heat.
2. If using banana leaves, rinse them under warm water and pat dry. Over an open flame or in a dry skillet, heat each leaf for a few seconds until pliable.
3. Line a large baking dish or roasting pan with the banana leaves, leaving enough overhang to wrap over the pork.
4. Remove the pork from the marinade, reserving the excess marinade. Arrange the pork in a single layer on the banana leaves. Pour the reserved marinade over the pork.
5. Fold the banana leaves over the pork to cover completely. If not using banana leaves, cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 3 to 4 hours, or until the pork is very tender and pulls apart easily with a fork.

### Serving:
1. Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes. Then, shred the pork using two forks.
2. Serve the cochinita pibil on warm corn tortillas, topped with pickled red onions, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice.

### Chef's Notes:
- The key to authentic cochinita pibil is the achiote paste, which gives the dish its signature color and flavor. It can be found in Latin American markets or online.
- Wrapping the pork in banana leaves not only imparts a subtle flavor but also keeps the meat moist during the slow cooking process. If unavailable, aluminum foil can be used as a substitute, though the flavor profile will slightly differ.
