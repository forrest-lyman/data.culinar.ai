# Garlic Aioli

Garlic Aioli is a versatile and flavorful condiment originating from the Mediterranean region, particularly popular in France, Spain, and Italy. It is essentially a garlic-flavored emulsion of garlic and olive oil and sometimes includes egg yolks for stability and lemon juice for acidity. This condiment pairs well with a variety of dishes, including grilled vegetables, fish, meat, and as a spread for sandwiches.

- **Origin**: Mediterranean (France, Spain, Italy)
- **Yield**: About 1 cup
- **Portion Size**: 1 tablespoon

## Ingredients

### For the Aioli:
- 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Optional for Variation:
- 1 tablespoon fresh herbs (such as parsley, dill, or chives), finely chopped

## Instructions

### Preparing the Base:
1. In a medium bowl, combine the egg yolk, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and minced garlic. Whisk together until well blended.
2. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper.

### Emulsifying the Aioli:
3. While whisking continuously, very slowly drizzle in the olive oil, starting with a few drops at a time. As the mixture begins to thicken, you can gradually increase the speed of adding oil. It's crucial to add the oil slowly to ensure the mixture emulsifies properly.
4. Once all the oil has been incorporated and the aioli has reached a thick and creamy consistency, taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or lemon juice if needed.

### Adding Optional Ingredients:
5. If using, fold in the finely chopped herbs to the aioli for added flavor.

### Serving:
6. Transfer the aioli to a serving dish or an airtight container. It can be served immediately or stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The flavors will continue to meld and develop as it sits.

### Chef's Notes:
- Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature to help the emulsion process.
- For a lighter version, you can substitute half of the olive oil with a neutral oil like canola or vegetable oil.
- If concerned about raw eggs, look for pasteurized eggs or you can make a mock aioli using mayonnaise as the base and adding minced garlic, lemon juice, and seasoning to taste.
