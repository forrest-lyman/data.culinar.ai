# Kibis

Kibis, a popular Yucatecan snack, has its roots in Lebanese cuisine, reflecting the rich cultural tapestry of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. This dish is a testament to the Lebanese immigrants who settled in Mexico in the early 20th century, bringing with them their culinary traditions. Kibis are essentially wheat bulgur fritters, seasoned with a blend of spices and filled with a variety of ingredients, most commonly ground meat. They are known for their crispy exterior and savory interior, making them a beloved street food and appetizer.

- **Origin**: Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico
- **Yield**: 20 pieces
- **Portion Size**: 1-2 kibis per person

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- 2 cups fine bulgur wheat
- 1 cup water (more if needed)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon dried mint

### For the Filling
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 pound ground beef or lamb
- 1/4 teaspoon allspice
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup pine nuts (optional)

### For Frying
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions

### Preparing the Dough
1. In a large bowl, soak the bulgur wheat in 1 cup of water for about 30 minutes, or until the bulgur is soft and has absorbed most of the water. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little more water until the bulgur is fully hydrated.
2. To the softened bulgur, add salt, black pepper, cumin, and dried mint. Mix thoroughly until the spices are evenly distributed. The mixture should be cohesive enough to form into shapes. If it's too wet, you can add a bit more bulgur or let it sit to absorb more moisture.

### Making the Filling
1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until the onion is translucent and fragrant.
2. Add the ground beef or lamb to the skillet, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until the meat is browned and fully cooked.
3. Season the meat mixture with allspice, salt, and pepper. Stir in the pine nuts if using, and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

### Forming and Frying the Kibis
1. Take a small portion of the bulgur dough, about the size of a golf ball, and flatten it into a disc in the palm of your hand.
2. Place a spoonful of the meat filling in the center of the disc, then carefully fold and shape the bulgur around the filling to form an oval-shaped kibi. Ensure the filling is completely enclosed.
3. In a deep frying pan or pot, heat the vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). Fry the kibis in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until they are golden brown and crispy, about 4-5 minutes.
4. Remove the kibis with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.

### Serving
Serve the kibis hot, accompanied by slices of lime and a dipping sauce of your choice, such as tahini or a yogurt-based sauce.

> **Chef's Notes:**
> - For a vegetarian version, the meat filling can be substituted with a mixture of cooked lentils, chopped nuts, and spices.
> - Kibis can be made ahead and frozen before frying. Thaw and fry them when ready to serve for a convenient snack or appetizer.
