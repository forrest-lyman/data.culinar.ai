# Traditional Spanish Paella

Paella is a vibrant and aromatic dish that is synonymous with Spanish cuisine. Originating from the Valencia region, this dish is a celebration of rice, saffron, and a variety of meats and seafood, cooked and served in a single pan. Paella is a versatile dish that can be adapted to include different proteins and vegetables, but the most traditional version, known as "Paella Valenciana," includes rabbit, chicken, green beans, and snails. The key to an authentic paella is the use of short-grain rice, which absorbs the flavors while maintaining its texture, and the creation of the coveted "socarrat" - the crispy crust that forms on the bottom of the pan.

## Origin

- Country: Spain
- Region: Valencia

## Yield

- Serves 4 to 6

## Portion Size

- 1 large serving spoon per person

## Ingredients

- 4 cups of short-grain Spanish rice, such as Bomba or Calasparra
- 8 cups of chicken or vegetable broth, warmed
- 1 large pinch of saffron threads, lightly crushed
- 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil
- 1 lb (450g) of chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 lb (450g) of rabbit, cut into bite-sized pieces (optional)
- 1 cup of green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup of tomato sauce or grated fresh tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon of sweet paprika
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into strips
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Lemon wedges, for serving
- Fresh rosemary sprigs, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Ingredients**: Begin by preparing all your ingredients. This includes chopping the chicken and rabbit (if using) into bite-sized pieces, trimming and cutting the green beans, mincing the garlic, chopping the onion, and slicing the red bell pepper.

2. **Sauté the Meats**: In a large paella pan or wide shallow skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and rabbit pieces, seasoning them with salt and pepper. Sauté until they are nicely browned but not fully cooked through. Remove the meats from the pan and set aside.

3. **Cook the Vegetables**: In the same pan, add the onion, garlic, and red bell pepper. Sauté until the onion is translucent. Stir in the green beans and cook for a couple of minutes.

4. **Add Rice and Spices**: Add the tomato sauce to the pan and cook until it darkens slightly, stirring frequently. Sprinkle the paprika over the mixture, then add the rice, stirring to coat the grains with the mixture.

5. **Add Broth and Saffron**: Pour the warm broth over the rice mixture. Add the saffron, stirring once to distribute it evenly. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to a low simmer.

6. **Cook the Paella**: Return the browned meats to the pan, tucking them into the rice. Cook without stirring, allowing the rice to absorb the liquid and the bottom to develop the socarrat. This should take about 20-25 minutes. If the rice appears dry during cooking, you can add a little more broth.

7. **Rest and Serve**: Once the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, remove the pan from the heat. Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking in its steam.

8. **Garnish and Serve**: Garnish the paella with lemon wedges and fresh rosemary sprigs, if desired. Serve directly from the pan, making sure to scrape the bottom to include the socarrat in each serving.

## Chef's Notes

- The key to a successful paella is not to stir the rice once you have added the broth. This allows the socarrat to form.
- If you cannot find rabbit, you can use additional chicken or even include seafood for a different variation.
- Paella is best enjoyed freshly made, but leftovers can be refrigerated and reheated gently, adding a little water to moisten the rice.
