# Cobb Salad

## Brief Description
Cobb Salad is a quintessential American garden salad that's a staple in many restaurants and households. Originating from the United States, specifically from the Brown Derby restaurant in Los Angeles in the 1930s, this salad is a colorful and hearty dish. It is traditionally made with a base of greens topped with rows of ingredients such as chicken, bacon, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, cheese, and tomatoes, dressed usually with a red-wine vinaigrette.

## Origin

## Yield
Serves 4

## Portion Size
1 serving per individual

## Ingredients

- 6 cups of mixed salad greens (such as romaine, watercress, endive, and iceberg lettuce), cleaned and chopped
- 2 chicken breasts, cooked and diced
- 8 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced
- 2 avocados, diced
- 1 cup of cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 cup of blue cheese, crumbled
- 1/4 cup of chives, finely chopped
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### For the Dressing:
- 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/2 cup of extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Salad Base:** In a large salad bowl, combine the mixed salad greens. This will form the base of your Cobb Salad.

2. **Assemble the Salad:** Arrange the chicken, bacon, hard-boiled eggs, avocados, cherry tomatoes, and blue cheese in neat rows on top of the greens. This presentation is characteristic of a traditional Cobb Salad.

3. **Make the Dressing:** In a small bowl, whisk together the red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, and minced garlic. Gradually whisk in the olive oil until the dressing is emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Dress the Salad:** Drizzle the dressing over the salad just before serving. Gently toss to ensure all the ingredients are lightly coated with the dressing.

5. **Garnish and Serve:** Sprinkle the chopped chives over the salad for a fresh, oniony bite. Season the salad with a final pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper.

6. **Serve Immediately:** Cobb Salad is best enjoyed fresh. Serve it immediately after dressing to enjoy the crispness of the greens and the creamy texture of the avocados.

## Chef's Notes

- **Customization:** Cobb Salad is highly customizable. Feel free to add or substitute ingredients based on preference or dietary restrictions. Common additions include cucumbers, bell peppers, or a different type of cheese such as feta or goat cheese.
- **Cooking the Chicken:** For added flavor, consider grilling the chicken breasts and seasoning them with herbs before dicing.
- **Vegetarian Option:** To make a vegetarian version of Cobb Salad, omit the chicken and bacon and add more vegetables or a plant-based protein like grilled tofu.
- **Dressing Variations:** While red wine vinaigrette is traditional, Cobb Salad can also be enjoyed with other dressings such as blue cheese dressing or ranch dressing for a different flavor profile.
