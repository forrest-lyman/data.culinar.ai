# Farinata

Farinata, also known as socca in France, is a traditional Italian flatbread made from chickpea flour. Originating from the Liguria region, this dish is a beloved street food and is known for its rich, nutty flavor and crisp, golden exterior. Farinata is not only delicious but also naturally gluten-free and vegan, making it a versatile dish that can be enjoyed by many.

- **Origin**: Italy (Liguria)
- **Yield**: 8 servings
- **Portion Size**: 1 slice

## Ingredients

- 2 cups chickpea flour (also known as gram or besan flour)
- 2 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- Optional toppings: rosemary, thinly sliced onions, or cherry tomatoes

## Instructions

### Batter Preparation

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour and water until smooth. Ensure there are no lumps in the mixture.
2. Stir in half of the olive oil (1/4 cup) and the salt. Mix well.
3. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the batter rest at room temperature for at least 4 hours, or overnight. This resting period allows the flour to fully hydrate and results in a better texture.

### Baking the Farinata

1. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Place a 12-inch cast iron skillet or a similar oven-proof pan in the oven to heat up for at least 10 minutes.
2. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven and add the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil, swirling to coat the bottom and sides of the skillet.
3. Stir the batter to reincorporate any separation, then pour it into the hot skillet. If using, sprinkle your chosen toppings (rosemary, onions, or tomatoes) over the batter.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy, and the center is firm.
5. Remove the skillet from the oven and let the farinata cool slightly before slicing into wedges.

### Serving

Serve the farinata warm, cut into wedges. It can be enjoyed on its own or with a side salad for a light meal.

## Chef's Notes

- The key to a perfect farinata is the consistency of the batter and the preheating of the skillet. These steps ensure a crispy exterior and a soft, flavorful interior.
- For a variation, try adding different herbs or spices to the batter before baking. Farinata is a versatile dish that can be customized to suit your taste preferences.
