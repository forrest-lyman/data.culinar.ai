# Chicago Deep Dish Pizza

The Chicago Deep Dish Pizza is a quintessential American dish that originated in the city of Chicago in the early 1940s. Unlike traditional pizza, this variant boasts a high edge and a thick layer of toppings, creating a hearty and filling meal. The deep-dish pizza is known for its inverted layering order, with cheese directly on the dough, followed by meats and vegetables, and finally topped with a can of crushed tomatoes. This recipe captures the essence of the classic Chicago-style deep dish pizza, offering a rich and satisfying experience.

- **Origin**: Chicago, USA
- **Yield**: 1 Pizza
- **Portion Size**: 8 slices

## Ingredients

### For the Dough:
- 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast (1 packet)
- 1 1/4 cups water, lukewarm
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- Additional 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, for layering

### For the Sauce:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Toppings:
- 1 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
- 1/2 pound Italian sausage, cooked and crumbled
- 1/2 cup pepperoni slices
- 1/2 cup green bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 cup onion, diced
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

### Prepare the Dough:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and instant yeast. Add lukewarm water and melted butter. Mix until a dough forms.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes.
3. Roll the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl, turning once to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

### Prepare the Sauce:
1. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Stir in crushed tomatoes, sugar, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool.

### Assemble the Pizza:
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 15-inch circle. Spread the softened butter over the dough, then fold it in half and then in half again (to form a quarter circle). Roll out again to a 15-inch circle.
3. Carefully transfer the dough to a 12-inch cast iron skillet or deep-dish pizza pan, pressing it into the corners and up the sides.
4. Layer the sliced mozzarella cheese directly on the dough. Add the cooked sausage, pepperoni, green bell pepper, and onion.
5. Spread the prepared sauce evenly over the top. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
7. Let the pizza cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

### Chef's Notes:
- For an authentic Chicago experience, some chefs add a layer of additional cheese on top of the sauce before baking.
- The dough can be made ahead and refrigerated overnight after the first rise. Allow it to come to room temperature before rolling out.
