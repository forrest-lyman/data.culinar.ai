- **Origin**: France
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 1/2 cups per serving

## Ingredients

### For the Soup
- 4 large yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 8 cups beef stock
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### For the Topping
- 4 slices of crusty bread, about 1-inch thick
- 1 cup grated Gruyère cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

### Caramelizing the Onions
1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and stir until they are well-coated with the butter mixture.
2. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the onions, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, or until they are deeply caramelized and golden brown. Sprinkle the sugar over the onions halfway through the cooking process to help with the caramelization.

### Making the Soup
1. Sprinkle the flour over the caramelized onions and cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes to cook off the raw flour taste.
2. Gradually add the beef stock, white wine, bay leaves, and thyme, stirring constantly to incorporate the flour into the liquid without lumps forming.
3. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the soup to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer gently, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Preparing the Topping
1. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the slices of bread on a baking sheet and brush both sides with melted butter. Broil until the bread is toasted and golden brown on both sides, about 1-2 minutes per side. Watch closely to prevent burning.
2. Remove the bay leaves from the soup and ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls. Place a slice of toasted bread on top of each serving of soup.
3. Mix together the Gruyère and Parmesan cheeses and sprinkle generously over the bread. Place the bowls under the broiler and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.

### Chef's Notes
- For a vegetarian version of this soup, substitute the beef stock with a rich vegetable stock. The depth of flavor will still be satisfying.
- The key to a great French Onion Soup is patience, especially when caramelizing the onions. This process can't be rushed, as the deep flavor development is crucial to the soup's overall taste.
