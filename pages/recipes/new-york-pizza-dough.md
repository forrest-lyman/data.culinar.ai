# New York Pizza Dough

New York-style pizza is characterized by its thin, flexible crust, slightly crispy on its edges yet soft enough to fold. Originating from New York City, USA, this style of pizza dough forms the foundation for countless pizzerias across the globe. The key to authentic New York pizza dough is high-gluten flour and a slow fermentation process, which together create its distinctive chewy texture.

- **Origin**: New York City, USA
- **Yield**: 2 pizza crusts
- **Portion Size**: 12-14 inches in diameter per crust

## Ingredients

- 4 cups (about 510g) high-gluten flour, plus more for dusting
- 1 ½ teaspoons (about 7g) sugar
- 1 tablespoon (about 9g) kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon (about 3g) instant yeast
- 1 ½ cups (355ml) cold water
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, plus more for greasing

## Instructions

1. **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the high-gluten flour, sugar, kosher salt, and instant yeast. Ensuring these ingredients are well mixed at this stage is crucial for the dough's texture.

2. **Add Water and Oil**: Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the cold water and olive oil. Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix until all the flour is hydrated and the dough begins to come together in a shaggy mass.

3. **Knead the Dough**: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead for approximately 10 to 12 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, elastic, and passes the windowpane test. This test involves stretching a small piece of dough between your fingers; if it can stretch thin enough to allow light to pass through without tearing, it's properly kneaded.

4. **First Rise**: Lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise at room temperature until it doubles in size, about 1 to 2 hours.

5. **Divide and Shape**: Punch down the risen dough to release any air bubbles. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces for two pizzas. Shape each piece into a tight ball by pulling the dough from the sides and tucking the ends underneath.

6. **Second Rise**: Place the dough balls on a lightly oiled baking sheet, spacing them apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let them rise for another 1 to 2 hours, or until nearly doubled in size again.

7. **Stretch the Dough**: Working with one ball of dough at a time, gently flatten it into a disk using your fingers. Starting at the center and working your way out, use your palms and fingertips to stretch the dough. Rotate it as you go, maintaining a circular shape. Leave a small border around the edge for the crust. Stretch it until it reaches your desired thickness, ideally about 12 to 14 inches in diameter.

8. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically between 475°F (245°C) and 500°F (260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.

9. **Bake**: Transfer the stretched dough onto a pizza peel dusted with flour or cornmeal. Add your toppings, then carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone or a baking sheet. Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.

10. **Serve**: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot.

## Chef's Notes

- **Water Temperature**: Using cold water helps control the temperature of the dough, making it easier to handle and extending the fermentation time, which is crucial for developing flavor.
  
- **Fermentation**: For an even more flavorful dough, you can let it ferment in the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours after the first rise. Simply punch down the dough, cover it tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Remove from the refrigerator 2 hours before you plan to shape it to allow it to come back to room temperature.

- **High-Gluten Flour**: This type of flour is essential for achieving the classic chewy texture of New York-style pizza. If unavailable, bread flour can be used as a substitute, though the texture may slightly differ.
