# New England Clam Chowder

New England Clam Chowder, a creamy and hearty soup, is a staple of Northeastern United States cuisine, particularly in Massachusetts and Maine. This dish is characterized by its use of fresh clams, potatoes, onions, and sometimes bacon or salt pork, immersed in a milk or cream-based broth. It's a comforting dish, especially popular during the cold months.

- **Origin**: Northeastern United States
- **Yield**: Serves 6
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 1/2 cups per serving

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 pound potatoes, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 cans (6.5 ounces each) chopped clams, drained, juice reserved
- 1 cup whole milk
- Optional: Crispy cooked bacon or salt pork, crumbled, for garnish
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Base**: In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and celery, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.

2. **Thicken the Soup**: Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste. Gradually whisk in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring there are no lumps.

3. **Add the Potatoes and Seasonings**: Stir in the heavy cream, diced potatoes, bay leaves, thyme, and reserved clam juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.

4. **Finish the Chowder**: Remove the bay leaves. Stir in the chopped clams and milk, and cook just until heated through, about 2 minutes. Avoid boiling after adding the clams to prevent them from becoming tough.

5. **Serve**: Ladle the chowder into bowls. If desired, garnish with crumbled bacon or salt pork and chopped parsley. Serve hot with oyster crackers or crusty bread on the side.

## Chef's Notes

- **Clam Selection**: For the best flavor, use fresh clams if available. Steam them until they open, then chop the meat and reserve the liquid to use in the chowder.
- **Consistency Adjustments**: If you prefer a thicker chowder, you can increase the amount of flour used for the roux. Conversely, for a thinner chowder, reduce the flour or add more milk to achieve your desired consistency.
- **Dairy Substitutes**: For a lighter version, whole milk can be used in place of heavy cream, though the chowder will be less rich.
- **Storage**: New England Clam Chowder can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently over low heat, adding additional milk if necessary to adjust the consistency.
