# Classic Carbonara

Carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta dish that originates from Rome. It is known for its creamy texture and rich flavors, achieved without the use of cream. The dish is made with eggs, hard cheese (Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano), cured pork (guanciale or pancetta), and black pepper. This recipe offers a taste of authentic Italian cuisine and demonstrates the simplicity and elegance of traditional Italian cooking.

- **Origin**: Italy, specifically Rome
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 cup per serving

## Ingredients

- 400g (14 oz) of spaghetti or linguine
- 150g (5.3 oz) of guanciale or pancetta, cut into small cubes
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup (100g) of freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Salt, for pasta water

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Pasta**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.

2. **Cook the Guanciale/Pancetta**: While the pasta is cooking, place a large skillet over medium heat. Add the guanciale or pancetta and cook until it is crispy and the fat has rendered, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside in the skillet.

3. **Mix Eggs and Cheese**: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper until well combined.

4. **Combine Pasta and Guanciale/Pancetta**: Return the skillet with the guanciale or pancetta to low heat. Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss to coat in the rendered fat.

5. **Create the Sauce**: Remove the skillet from the heat. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, stirring vigorously with tongs or a fork to combine. The residual heat will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until the desired consistency is reached.

6. **Serve**: Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper.

### Chef's Notes:

- The key to a creamy carbonara is to work quickly and ensure that the eggs do not scramble. The residual heat from the pasta and the pan is sufficient to cook the eggs gently, creating a smooth and creamy sauce.
- Traditional carbonara does not include cream. The creaminess of the dish comes from the emulsion of the eggs, cheese, and pasta water.
- Guanciale is traditional in carbonara, but pancetta is a good substitute if guanciale is not available.
