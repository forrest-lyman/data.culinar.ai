- 1 teaspoon grated [garlic](/page/product/garlic-1709152079830)

### For the Coating
- 100g (about 3/4 cup) [potato starch](/page/product/potato-starch-1709151886102) or cornstarch
- [Peanut oil](/page/product/peanut-oil-1709151976755), for deep frying

## Instructions

### Preparing the Chicken
1. In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, sake, mirin, grated ginger, and grated garlic to make the marinade.
2. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or for better flavor, leave it overnight.

### Coating and Frying
1. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature, about 15 minutes before frying.
2. Heat oil in a deep fryer or a large, deep pan to 180째C (350째F). While the oil is heating, place the potato starch in a shallow bowl.
3. Coat each piece of marinated chicken in the potato starch, shaking off any excess.
4. Fry the chicken in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 75째C (165째F).
5. Place the fried chicken on a wire rack or paper towels to drain any excess oil.

### Serving
1. Serve the karaage chicken hot, garnished with lemon wedges and a side of mayonnaise or your preferred dipping sauce. It can also be enjoyed with a side of shredded cabbage or rice.

## Chef's Notes
- Marinating the chicken overnight will enhance the flavors and tenderize the meat, resulting in a more flavorful dish.
- Using potato starch as the coating gives the chicken a lighter, crispier texture compared to using all-purpose flour. However, cornstarch is a suitable alternative if potato starch is not available.
- To ensure even cooking, try to cut the chicken pieces into uniform sizes.
