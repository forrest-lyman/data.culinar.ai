# Tinga de Pollo

Tinga de Pollo, a savory and slightly spicy dish, hails from the heart of Mexico. It is a traditional recipe that combines the tender texture of shredded chicken with the rich flavors of tomatoes, onions, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. This dish is often served atop tostadas and garnished with avocado slices, fresh cheese, and sour cream, making it a versatile component in Mexican cuisine. It's perfect for gatherings or a flavorful family dinner.

- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: Serves 6
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 2/3 cup per serving

## Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs (680g) of boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) of vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 can (14 oz or 400g) of diced tomatoes, drained
- 2-3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) of the adobo sauce (from the chipotle peppers can)
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5ml) of dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup (120ml) of chicken broth
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
- Slices of avocado, fresh cheese, and sour cream (for serving)

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Chicken**: In a large pot, cover the chicken breasts with water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove the chicken, let it cool, and then shred it using two forks. Set aside.

2. **Prepare the Tinga Sauce**: In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and cook until it's soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.

3. **Combine Ingredients**: To the skillet, add the drained diced tomatoes, chopped chipotle peppers, adobo sauce and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.

4. **Simmer**: Add the shredded chicken to the skillet, along with the chicken broth. Stir well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.

5. **Serve**: Serve the Tinga de Pollo on tostadas, garnished with chopped cilantro, slices of avocado, fresh cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.

## Chef's Notes

- For a less spicy version, reduce the amount of chipotle peppers used. The adobo sauce can also be adjusted according to taste preferences.
- Tinga de Pollo can be made ahead of time and refrigerated, as the flavors tend to deepen and meld together when stored.
- This dish is incredibly versatile and can also be served in tacos, burritos, or even as a main dish alongside rice and beans.
