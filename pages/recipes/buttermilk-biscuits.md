# Buttermilk Biscuits

Buttermilk biscuits are a staple in Southern American cuisine, known for their flaky, buttery layers and golden-brown exterior. Originating from the American South, these biscuits have become a beloved addition to any meal, from breakfast to dinner. They are perfect when served warm, slathered with butter, or used as a base for dishes like biscuits and gravy.

- **Origin**: Southern United States
- **Yield**: 12 biscuits
- **Portion Size**: 1 biscuit

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cubed
- 1 cup cold buttermilk

### For Brushing (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven and Prepare Baking Sheet**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent sticking.

2. **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

3. **Cut in Butter**: Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining. This process is crucial for creating flaky layers.

4. **Add Buttermilk**: Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk. Gently fold the ingredients together using a spatula or your hands until just combined. Avoid overmixing to ensure tender biscuits.

5. **Form Biscuits**: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat it into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Fold the dough in half over itself and gently flatten again. Repeat this folding process 3-4 times to create layers.

6. **Cut Out Biscuits**: Using a floured biscuit cutter or a glass, press straight down to cut out biscuits. Do not twist the cutter, as this seals the edges and impedes rising. Re-form the dough scraps to cut out additional biscuits.

7. **Bake**: Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they slightly touch each other for support. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top.

8. **Brush with Butter (Optional)**: If desired, brush the tops of the baked biscuits with melted butter for a richer flavor and a soft crust.

### Chef's Notes

- Keeping the butter and buttermilk cold is essential for achieving flaky biscuits. The cold fat creates steam pockets when baked, leading to the desired layers.
- For an extra rise, you can place the cut biscuits in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. This step ensures the butter is very cold, enhancing the flakiness of the biscuits.
