# Cedar Plank Roasted Salmon

Cedar plank roasted salmon is a culinary technique that infuses salmon with the subtle, smoky flavors of cedar wood. This method of cooking, which originates from the Native American tribes of the Pacific Northwest, USA, allows the salmon to gently steam while absorbing the aromatic qualities of the cedar. It's a simple yet sophisticated way to prepare salmon, perfect for both casual and elegant dining.

## Origin

- **Country or Region:** Pacific Northwest, USA

## Yield

- **Portion Size:** Serves 4

## Ingredients

- 1 cedar plank (about 12 inches long), soaked in water for at least 2 hours
- 4 salmon fillets (6 ounces each), skin on
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 lemon, thinly sliced (for garnish)
- Fresh dill sprigs (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the Grill:** Preheat your outdoor grill to a medium-high heat, around 375°F (190°C). Ensure the grill is clean and well-oiled to prevent sticking.

2. **Prepare the Cedar Plank:** While the grill is heating, remove the cedar plank from the water and pat it dry. Lightly oil one side of the plank with a tablespoon of olive oil. This will be the side on which you'll place the salmon.

3. **Season the Salmon:** Brush the salmon fillets on both sides with the remaining olive oil. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. 

4. **Plank the Salmon:** Arrange the salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the oiled side of the cedar plank. If desired, you can place lemon slices under and on top of the salmon fillets for added flavor.

5. **Grill the Salmon:** Place the cedar plank with the salmon on the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fillets and the temperature of the grill.

6. **Serve:** Carefully remove the cedar plank from the grill (it will be hot). Check the salmon for doneness. The internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C) when measured with a food thermometer. Garnish the salmon with fresh dill sprigs and additional lemon slices if desired.

7. **Enjoy:** Serve the cedar plank roasted salmon directly from the plank for a rustic presentation, or transfer the fillets to a serving platter.

## Chef's Notes

- **Cedar Plank Selection:** Use untreated, food-grade cedar planks available at most culinary stores or online. Avoid using cedar shingles or planks from a lumber yard, as they may be treated with chemicals not safe for cooking.

- **Soaking the Plank:** Soaking the cedar plank in water for at least 2 hours (or overnight) is crucial to prevent it from catching fire on the grill. For added flavor, you can soak the plank in white wine, cider, or sake.

- **Indoor Cooking Alternative:** If you don't have access to an outdoor grill, this recipe can be adapted for the oven. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and place the prepared cedar plank with salmon on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through.

This cedar plank roasted salmon recipe highlights the natural flavors of the fish with a delightful smoky essence from the cedar. It's a testament to the simplicity and elegance of Pacific Northwest cuisine.
