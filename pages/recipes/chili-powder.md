# Homemade Chili Powder

Chili powder is a versatile and essential spice blend in many cuisines, particularly in Mexican and Southwestern American dishes. It adds depth, heat, and complexity to recipes. Unlike single-ingredient chili powders made solely from ground chilis, this homemade version incorporates a variety of spices to create a well-rounded, flavorful blend.

**Origin:** Mexico/Southwestern United States

**Yield:** About 1/2 cup

**Portion Size:** 1 tablespoon

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup paprika
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for a smoky flavor)
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste for heat)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

### Preparing the Spice Blend

1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, mix together the paprika, ground cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, smoked paprika (if using), cayenne pepper, and ground black pepper until well combined.
   
2. **Sift the Blend:** To ensure a fine, even texture, sift the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into another bowl. This step is optional but recommended for removing any large particles and ensuring a smooth consistency in the powder.

3. **Storage:** Transfer the chili powder into an airtight container. Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. The chili powder will retain its potency and flavor for up to 6 months.

### Chef's Notes

- **Customizing Heat Levels:** The beauty of making your own chili powder is the ability to adjust the heat to your preference. Increase or decrease the amount of cayenne pepper to control the spiciness.
- **Smoked Paprika:** Adding smoked paprika is optional but provides an additional layer of smoky flavor that complements many dishes, especially those involving grilling or smoking.
- **Usage:** Homemade chili powder is incredibly versatile. Use it in chili con carne, tacos, soups, stews, marinades, and rubs to add a rich, spicy flavor.
