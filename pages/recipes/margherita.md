# Classic Margherita Pizza

The Margherita Pizza is a timeless classic that originated from Naples, Italy. It is celebrated for its simplicity, featuring the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). This recipe yields a pizza that is both crispy and chewy, with the freshness of basil complementing the richness of the cheese and the acidity of the tomato sauce.

- **Origin**: Naples, Italy
- **Yield**: 1 Pizza
- **Portion Size**: 4 servings

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 250g (2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- 160ml (2/3 cup) warm water
- 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing

### Topping
- 200g (7 oz) mozzarella cheese, sliced or torn into small pieces
- 150ml (2/3 cup) tomato sauce (preferably homemade)
- Fresh basil leaves
- Salt, to taste
- Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling

## Instructions

### Preparing the Dough
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Gradually add the warm water and olive oil, mixing until a dough begins to form.
2. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.
3. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.

### Shaping and Topping
1. Preheat your oven to its highest setting, ideally between 250째C - 300째C (482째F - 572째F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.
2. Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll it out into a 12-inch circle, creating a slightly thicker edge for the crust.
3. Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper. This will make it easier to move the pizza.
4. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Distribute the mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.
5. Carefully transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet.
6. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.
7. Remove from the oven and immediately top with fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle a pinch of salt over the top.

### Chef's Notes
- For the best flavor, use high-quality mozzarella and make your tomato sauce from scratch. A simple sauce can be made by simmering crushed tomatoes with garlic, olive oil, salt, and a touch of basil.
- The high oven temperature is crucial for achieving a pizzeria-style crust. If using a baking sheet, preheating it will help cook the bottom of the pizza more effectively.
- Fresh basil is added after baking to preserve its flavor and vibrant green color.
