# Achiote Paste

Achiote paste, also known as recado rojo, is a vibrant, deeply colored spice blend that's a cornerstone of Mexican and Central American cuisine. Originating from the Yucatán Peninsula, this paste combines the earthy, peppery flavor of annatto seeds with a mix of spices and ingredients, offering a unique taste and an iconic red hue to various dishes. It's commonly used as a marinade for meats, especially in dishes like cochinita pibil, or to add depth and color to rice and vegetable dishes.

- **Origin**: Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico
- **Yield**: About 1 cup
- **Portion Size**: 1-2 tablespoons

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup annatto seeds
- 1/4 cup white vinegar
- 1/4 cup orange juice
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 1/2 teaspoon cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons achiote (if available, for enhanced color and flavor)

### Optional Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds (for added depth)
- 1 small cinnamon stick (for a hint of warmth)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Spices**: In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the annatto seeds, cumin seeds, black peppercorns, cloves, and optional coriander seeds and cinnamon stick. Stir constantly to prevent burning, until they become fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

2. **Grind the Spices**: Once cooled, transfer the toasted spices to a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Grind them to a fine powder. This may need to be done in batches depending on the size of your grinder.

3. **Blend the Paste**: Transfer the ground spices to a blender. Add the minced garlic, dried Mexican oregano, salt, vinegar, orange juice, lemon juice, and optional achiote. Blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary to ensure an even consistency.

4. **Adjust Consistency**: If the paste is too thick, add a little more vinegar or citrus juice to reach the desired consistency. It should be thick yet spreadable.

5. **Store**: Transfer the achiote paste to an airtight container. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a month or frozen for longer storage.

### Chef's Notes
- Annatto seeds are the key ingredient for their color and earthy flavor, but they can stain, so handle with care.
- Adjust the amount of spices and seasonings according to your taste preferences. Some like it more garlicky or with a stronger citrus note.
- For a smoother paste, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any unblended spices or seeds.
