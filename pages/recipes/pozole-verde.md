# Pozole Verde
Pozole Verde, a vibrant and hearty Mexican soup, is a delightful variation of the traditional Pozole. Originating from Mexico, this dish is celebrated for its rich combination of hominy, chicken, and a green sauce made from tomatillos and green chilies. It's a staple during festivities and a comforting meal during the colder months. The green sauce lends a fresh, tangy flavor that contrasts beautifully with the deep flavors of the broth and meat.

## Instructions

### Preparing the Green Sauce:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add tomatillos, poblano peppers, and jalapeños. Cook for about 10 minutes or until tomatillos are soft.
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the boiled vegetables to a blender. Add cilantro, chopped onion, garlic, and cumin to the blender.
3. Blend until smooth. Set the green sauce aside.

### Cooking the Pozole:
1. In a large pot, combine chicken thighs, chicken broth, chopped onion, minced garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
3. Remove the chicken from the pot and shred it using two forks. Discard the bay leaves.
4. Return the shredded chicken to the pot, add the drained hominy, and the green sauce. Stir well to combine.
5. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for an additional 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
6. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

### Serving:
1. Ladle the Pozole Verde into bowls.
2. Offer the garnishes in separate dishes so everyone can customize their Pozole Verde to their liking.

## Chef's Notes:
- For a vegetarian version, substitute chicken with vegetable broth and use mushrooms or zucchini as the protein.
- The heat level of the Pozole can be adjusted by the number and type of peppers used in the green sauce. Removing the seeds and membranes of the peppers will reduce the heat.
