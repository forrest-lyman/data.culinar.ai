- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: 8 servings
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1.5 cups

## Ingredients

### For the Broth
- 2 pounds honeycomb tripe, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 cow's foot (optional), split into quarters
- 1 large onion, quartered
- 8 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 10 cups water

### For the Red Chili Paste
- 5 guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 3 ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- Salt, to taste

### Additional Ingredients
- 1 (15-ounce) can hominy, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- 1 white onion, finely chopped
- 4 limes, cut into wedges
- Dried oregano (Mexican, if available)
- Crushed red pepper flakes

## Instructions

### Preparing the Tripe and Broth
1. Rinse the tripe and cow's foot (if using) under cold water. Place them in a large pot along with the quartered onion, 8 cloves of garlic, bay leaves, and salt. Cover with 10 cups of water.
2. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, or until the tripe is tender. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface.
3. Remove the tripe and cow's foot from the broth. Once cool enough to handle, chop the tripe into bite-sized pieces. If you used a cow's foot, discard the bones and chop any meaty parts to add back into the soup.

### Making the Red Chili Paste
1. While the tripe is cooking, prepare the red chili paste. Place the guajillo and ancho chiles in a bowl and cover with 2 cups of boiling water. Let them soak for 20 minutes to soften.
2. Transfer the softened chiles and about 1 cup of the soaking liquid to a blender. Add the oregano, cumin, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible.

### Finishing the Menudo
1. Return the chopped tripe (and cow's foot meat, if using) to the broth. Stir in the red chili paste and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
2. Add the drained hominy to the pot and continue to simmer for another 30 minutes to blend the flavors. Season with additional salt, if needed.
3. Serve the Menudo Rojo hot, garnished with chopped cilantro, chopped onion, lime wedges, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes, allowing each person to customize their bowl.

### Chef's Notes
- The cow's foot adds gelatin to the broth, giving it a rich, silky texture. However, it can be omitted if unavailable.
- For a milder soup, remove the seeds from the chiles before soaking.
- Menudo is traditionally served with corn tortillas and a variety of fresh garnishes. Feel free to add or substitute garnishes according to personal preference.
