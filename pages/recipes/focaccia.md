# Focaccia

Focaccia is a flat oven-baked Italian bread, similar in style and texture to pizza doughs. It is typically seasoned with olive oil, salt, and often topped with herbs and other ingredients. Originating from Italy, specifically the Liguria region, focaccia serves as a staple in Italian cuisine and has numerous variations across the country. It can be served as a side dish, sandwich bread, or as a snack.

- **Origin**: Italy, Liguria region
- **Yield**: 1 large focaccia
- **Portion Size**: 8-10 servings

## Ingredients

- 500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp granulated sugar
- 7g (1 packet) instant yeast
- 350ml (1 ½ cups) warm water
- 60ml (¼ cup) extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 2 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped
- Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast. Gradually add the warm water to the dry ingredients, mixing until a sticky dough forms. Add ¼ cup of olive oil and incorporate it into the dough.

2. **First Rise**: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

3. **Shape and Second Rise**: Drizzle olive oil over a baking sheet and spread it around to coat the surface. Transfer the risen dough to the baking sheet and gently stretch it out to fit the size of the pan. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise again for 20-30 minutes.

4. **Preheat the Oven**: While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F).

5. **Add Toppings**: Once the dough has finished its second rise, use your fingertips to create dimples across the entire surface. Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle the chopped rosemary and coarse sea salt evenly over the top.

6. **Bake**: Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the focaccia is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

7. **Serve**: Let the focaccia cool slightly on a wire rack before cutting into pieces and serving.

## Chef's Notes

- **Variations**: Focaccia can be topped with a variety of ingredients. For a different flavor, consider adding thinly sliced tomatoes, olives, caramelized onions, or grated Parmesan cheese before baking.
- **Storage**: Focaccia is best enjoyed the day it is made but can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in the oven or toaster for best results.
- **Serving Suggestion**: For a traditional Italian experience, serve focaccia alongside a selection of cured meats, cheeses, and olives as part of an antipasto platter.
