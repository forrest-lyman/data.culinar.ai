# Menudo Blanco

Menudo Blanco, or White Menudo, is a traditional Mexican soup known for its rich flavors and hearty ingredients. Originating from the northern regions of Mexico, this dish is particularly popular for breakfast and during festive occasions. Unlike the more common red menudo, which includes chili peppers in its broth, Menudo Blanco boasts a clear broth that highlights the natural flavors of its ingredients. It's a comforting and restorative dish often enjoyed as a remedy for various ailments, including hangovers.

- **Origin**: Northern Mexico
- **Yield**: 8 servings
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1 Â½ cups

## Ingredients

### For the Broth
- 2 pounds of beef tripe, cleaned and cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cow's foot (optional, but recommended for gelatinous texture), split into quarters
- 1 large white onion, quartered
- 8 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon of salt, or to taste
- 10 cups of water, or enough to cover the ingredients

### For Serving
- 1 cup of chopped white onion
- 1 cup of chopped cilantro
- 2 limes, cut into wedths
- Dried oregano (optional)
- Crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
- Warm corn tortillas

## Instructions

### Preparing the Ingredients
1. Begin by thoroughly cleaning the beef tripe under cold running water. Make sure to remove any impurities or excess fat. Cut the tripe into 1-2 inch pieces.
2. If using a cow's foot, ensure it's been split into quarters by your butcher for easier handling.

### Cooking the Broth
1. In a large pot, combine the cleaned tripe, cow's foot (if using), quartered onion, garlic cloves, bay leaves, and salt. Add enough water to cover the ingredients by at least an inch.
2. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface during the first few minutes of boiling.
3. Cover and simmer on low heat for about 4 hours, or until the tripe is tender and the broth has a rich, flavorful consistency. If the water level decreases significantly during cooking, add more water to maintain the level of ingredients.
4. Once the tripe is tender, remove the cow's foot pieces. You can strip any meat off the bones and return it to the pot, discarding the bones and any hard parts.

### Serving
1. Ladle the hot Menudo into bowls. Serve with bowls of chopped onions, cilantro, lime wedges, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes on the side, allowing each person to customize their bowl to their liking.
2. Warm corn tortillas are traditionally served alongside Menudo Blanco, perfect for dipping into the broth.

### Chef's Notes
- The key to a clear, flavorful broth in Menudo Blanco is the initial boiling and thorough skimming of impurities. This step ensures a clean taste and appearance.
- For those who prefer a slightly thicker broth, simmering the soup uncovered during the last hour of cooking can help reduce and concentrate the flavors.
- Menudo is often enjoyed as part of a communal meal, especially during holidays and family gatherings. Its preparation and consumption are steeped in tradition, making it more than just a meal but a cultural experience.
