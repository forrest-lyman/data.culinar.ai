# Dirty Bird Seasoning

Dirty Bird Seasoning is a robust and versatile blend, perfect for adding a deep, smoky, and slightly spicy flavor to poultry dishes. Originating from the Southern United States, this seasoning combines traditional spices to create a flavor profile that enhances the natural taste of chicken, turkey, and other birds. It's ideal for grilling, roasting, or frying, making it a must-have in any kitchen.

- **Origin**: Southern United States
- **Yield**: About 1 cup
- **Portion Size**: Varies depending on application

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste for heat)
- 1 tablespoon ground mustard
- 1 tablespoon celery salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice

## Instructions

### Mixing the Seasoning

1. **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ground black pepper, dried thyme, dried oregano, cayenne pepper, ground mustard, celery salt, ground cumin, and ground allspice until well combined.
   
2. **Sift for Consistency**: For a finer, more uniform texture, sift the mixture through a fine mesh sieve. This step is optional but recommended for a smoother application on meats.

3. **Storage**: Transfer the seasoning blend to an airtight container. Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. The seasoning will keep for up to 6 months, retaining its flavor and potency.

### Application Tips

- **For Grilling or Roasting**: Generously rub the Dirty Bird Seasoning onto the surface of the poultry, ensuring an even coat. Allow the meat to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the refrigerator for deeper flavor infusion.
  
- **For Frying**: Mix the seasoning with flour or breadcrumbs to create a flavorful coating for fried chicken or turkey cutlets.

## Chef's Notes

- Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper based on your heat preference. The recipe as is provides a moderate kick, but can be increased for those who enjoy spicier dishes.
- This seasoning can also be used as a base for barbecue sauces or marinades by mixing it with wet ingredients like vinegar, oil, or citrus juice.
- Experiment with adding a tablespoon of brown sugar to the mix for a slightly sweet, caramelized flavor when cooking at high temperatures.
