# Buridda (Genoese Fish Stew)

Buridda is a traditional Ligurian fish stew, originating from the coastal region of Liguria in Italy. This savory, aromatic dish is a testament to the region's rich maritime history and its reliance on the bounty of the sea. Buridda is characterized by its variety of seafood, simmered in a tomato-based broth with garlic, herbs, and often accompanied by toasted bread or polenta. It's a celebration of simplicity and the fresh flavors of the Mediterranean.

- **Origin**: Liguria, Italy
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1.5 cups

## Ingredients

### For the Stew
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, finely diced
- 1 stalk celery, finely diced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 can (28 ounces) whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand
- 1 cup fish stock or water
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 pound mixed seafood (such as shrimp, squid, and firm white fish like cod or halibut), cleaned and cut into bite-sized pieces

### For Serving
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Lemon wedges
- Toasted bread or cooked polenta

## Instructions

### Preparing the Base
1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. SautÃ© until the vegetables are soft but not browned, about 5 minutes.
2. Pour in the white wine and let it simmer until reduced by half, which will take about 3 minutes.
3. Add the crushed tomatoes, fish stock or water, bay leaf, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
4. Reduce the heat to low and let the stew simmer gently, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally.

### Adding the Seafood
1. Add the mixed seafood to the pot, ensuring it is submerged in the liquid. Cover and cook over low heat until the seafood is cooked through, about 5-7 minutes, depending on the size and variety of seafood used.
2. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.

### Serving
1. Discard the bay leaf. Ladle the stew into bowls.
2. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
3. Accompany with toasted bread or a side of cooked polenta for a complete meal.

## Chef's Notes
- The choice of seafood can vary based on availability and personal preference. Traditional Buridda often includes a variety of fish, shellfish, and sometimes even octopus.
- For an authentic touch, consider adding a pinch of saffron to the stew with the tomatoes. It lends a beautiful color and a subtle complexity to the dish.
- If using larger pieces of fish, consider searing them separately before adding to the stew to ensure a more textured finish.
