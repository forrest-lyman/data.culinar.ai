Originating from the bayous of Louisiana, this dish is a celebration of local ingredients and Cajun spices, perfect for outdoor gatherings and warm weather.

- **Origin**: Louisiana, USA
- **Yield**: Serves 10
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1-1.5 pounds of crawfish per person

## Ingredients

- 30 pounds live crawfish
- 5 gallons water
- 1 (4.5-pound) bag of crawfish boil seasoning
- 8 onions, quartered
- 10 heads of garlic, halved horizontally
- 10 lemons, halved
- 5 pounds small red potatoes
- 10 ears of corn, halved
- 2 pounds smoked sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Crawfish**: Begin by purging the crawfish in clean water to remove any mud and debris. This can be done by soaking them in a large container of water and gently agitating them, then draining and repeating the process until the water runs clear.

2. **Boiling the Water**: In a large 40-quart stockpot, bring 5 gallons of water to a rolling boil. Add the crawfish boil seasoning, onions, garlic, and lemons to the water, stirring to ensure the seasoning is well dissolved.

3. **Cooking the Vegetables**: Add the red potatoes to the pot and boil for about 10 minutes. Then, add the corn and smoked sausage to the pot and cook for another 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

4. **Adding the Crawfish**: Add the cleaned crawfish to the pot, and return the water to a boil. Once boiling, cook for about 5 minutes, then turn off the heat. Allow the crawfish and vegetables to soak in the hot water for an additional 15-20 minutes to absorb the flavors.

5. **Serving**: Carefully drain the water from the pot. Pour the contents of the pot onto a large table covered with newspaper or a disposable tablecloth for a traditional serving method. Ensure to provide plenty of paper towels, and bowls for the discarded shells.

## Chef's Notes

- The key to a successful crawfish boil is in the seasoning. Feel free to adjust the amount of crawfish boil seasoning to suit your taste preference. Some like it spicier, while others prefer it milder.
- Purging the crawfish is a crucial step to ensure they are clean before cooking. Skipping this step may result in gritty crawfish.
- The soaking period after boiling is essential for flavor development. Do not rush this step, as it allows the crawfish to absorb the spicy, aromatic flavors from the boil.
