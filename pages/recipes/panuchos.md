**Origin:** Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico

**Yield:** 10 Panuchos

**Portion Size:** 1 Panucho

## Ingredients

### For the Tortillas:
- 2 cups masa harina
- 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### For the Refried Beans:
- 1 cup black beans, cooked and drained
- 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil
- 1/4 onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Salt, to taste

### For the Toppings:
- 2 cups cooked chicken, shredded
- 1 cup pickled red onions
- 1 avocado, sliced
- Lettuce, shredded (optional)
- Tomato, sliced (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparing the Tortillas:
1. In a large bowl, mix the masa harina with salt. Gradually add warm water, kneading until the dough is firm and springy. If the dough is too dry, add a bit more water; if too sticky, add more masa harina.
2. Divide the dough into 10 equal balls. Flatten each ball into a thin circle, about 5 inches in diameter, using a tortilla press or rolling pin between two pieces of plastic wrap.
3. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla for about 30 seconds on each side, or until they start to puff up. Remove from heat and set aside.

### Preparing the Refried Beans:
1. Heat the lard or oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sautéing until they are soft and translucent.
2. Add the cooked black beans and mash them while they cook with the onions and garlic. If the mixture is too dry, add a little water. Season with salt to taste. Cook until the beans are thickened into a paste. Remove from heat.

### Assembling the Panuchos:
1. Carefully split the edge of each tortilla to create a pocket, being careful not to tear it completely.
2. Stuff a spoonful of the refried beans inside each tortilla pocket, then carefully seal it.
3. Heat a thin layer of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each stuffed tortilla until it is crispy and golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
4. Top each panucho with shredded chicken, pickled red onions, avocado slices, and if desired, lettuce and tomato.

## Chef's Notes:
- Panuchos are best enjoyed fresh and hot, right after assembling.
- The pickled red onions are a key component, adding a bright acidity that balances the richness of the beans and chicken. They can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator.
- For a vegetarian version, omit the chicken and add more vegetables, such as roasted peppers or sautéed mushrooms, as toppings.
