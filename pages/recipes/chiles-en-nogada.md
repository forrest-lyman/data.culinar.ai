# Chiles en Nogada

Chiles en Nogada is a renowned Mexican dish that perfectly embodies the spirit of Mexican cuisine with its rich flavors and vibrant colors. Originating from Puebla, this dish is deeply rooted in the country's history, often associated with the independence of Mexico. It is traditionally prepared in August and September to coincide with the Mexican Independence celebrations. The dish features poblano chiles stuffed with a picadillo (a mixture of meat, fruits, and spices), covered in a walnut-based cream sauce, and finally garnished with pomegranate seeds and parsley, mirroring the colors of the Mexican flag.

- **Origin**: Puebla, Mexico
- **Yield**: Serves 6
- **Portion Size**: 1 chile per serving

## Ingredients

### For the Picadillo:
- 6 poblano peppers, charred, peeled, and deseeded
- 500g ground pork
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 1/2 apple, peeled and diced
- 1/2 pear, peeled and diced
- 1/2 peach, peeled and diced
- 1/4 cup raisins
- 1/4 cup almonds, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

### For the Nogada (Walnut Sauce):
- 1 cup walnuts, soaked overnight and peeled
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup Mexican crema (or crème fraîche)
- 1/4 cup sherry
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- A pinch of salt

### For Garnishing:
- 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds
- Fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

### Preparing the Picadillo:
1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, sautéing until translucent.
2. Add the ground pork to the skillet, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until it's no longer pink.
3. Mix in the chopped tomatoes, apple, pear, peach, raisins, almonds, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Cook the mixture over low heat for about 25 minutes, or until the fruits are soft and the flavors have melded together. Set aside to cool.

### Preparing the Nogada:
1. In a blender, combine the soaked and peeled walnuts, milk, Mexican crema, sherry, sugar, and a pinch of salt.
2. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little more milk to reach the desired consistency.

### Assembling the Chiles:
1. Carefully stuff each poblano pepper with the picadillo mixture, ensuring they are well filled but not bursting.
2. Arrange the stuffed chiles on a serving platter.
3. Generously drizzle the walnut sauce over the chiles, ensuring they are completely covered.
4. Garnish with pomegranate seeds and fresh parsley leaves just before serving.

## Chef's Notes:
- The key to a successful Chiles en Nogada lies in the balance of flavors and textures. The picadillo should be savory with a hint of sweetness, complemented by the creamy, nutty sauce.
- For a vegetarian version, replace the ground pork with a mixture of quinoa and finely chopped vegetables.
- It's essential to handle the poblano peppers gently to avoid tearing them when stuffing.
