# Classic Southern Cornbread

Cornbread is a traditional staple in Southern American cuisine, cherished for its simplicity and rustic charm. Originating from the Southern United States, this dish has been a cornerstone of the region's diet since Native American times, utilizing locally grown corn. Perfect as a side for chili, barbecues, or enjoyed on its own, this cornbread recipe offers a delightful blend of savory and slightly sweet flavors, with a beautifully golden crust and a tender crumb.

- **Origin**: Southern United States
- **Yield**: 1 loaf
- **Portion Size**: 8-10 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1/4 cup honey

### Optional for Serving
- Butter
- Honey

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven and Prepare Pan**: Preheat your oven to 400Â°F (200Â°C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan or cast iron skillet with butter or non-stick cooking spray.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, mix the buttermilk, melted butter, eggs, and honey until smooth.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined; be careful not to overmix. The batter should be lumpy.

5. **Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared pan or skillet. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.

6. **Cool and Serve**: Allow the cornbread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm with butter and honey, if desired.

### Chef's Notes

- For a more traditional Southern cornbread, you can omit the sugar. Southern cornbread is typically less sweet than its Northern counterpart.
- If you prefer a crisper crust, preheat your cast iron skillet in the oven before adding the batter. This method creates a beautifully crispy exterior.
- Cornbread is best enjoyed fresh but can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or refrigerated for up to a week.
