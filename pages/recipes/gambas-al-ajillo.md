# Gambas al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)

Gambas al Ajillo, or Garlic Shrimp, is a popular and traditional Spanish tapas dish, known for its rich garlic flavor complemented by a spicy kick. Originating from Spain, this dish is typically served in a terracotta dish, sizzling with olive oil. It's a simple yet flavorful recipe that highlights the quality of its few ingredients.

- **Origin**: Spain
- **Yield**: Serves 4
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 5-6 shrimp per person

## Ingredients

- 1 pound (450g) large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup (120ml) olive oil
- 2 teaspoons (10ml) brandy (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5ml) red chili flakes (adjust to taste)
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges for serving

### For Serving

- Crusty bread, for dipping

## Instructions

1. **Preparation of Ingredients**: Begin by ensuring your shrimp are properly cleaned, peeled, and deveined. Thinly slice the garlic cloves. Chop the parsley finely and set aside. Have your lemon wedges ready for serving.

2. **Cooking the Shrimp**: In a large skillet or a traditional terracotta dish, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic to the oil, sautéing until they are just golden and fragrant. This should take about 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.

3. **Adding Flavor**: To the skillet, add the red chili flakes and stir for about 30 seconds to infuse the oil with spice. Immediately add the shrimp to the skillet, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until the shrimp turn pink and opaque.

4. **Final Touches**: If using, pour the brandy over the shrimp and carefully flambé by lighting it with a match. Let the flames subside naturally. This step is optional but adds a depth of flavor.

5. **Garnishing and Serving**: Sprinkle the cooked shrimp with freshly chopped parsley. Serve immediately in the skillet or a serving dish, accompanied by lemon wedges and crusty bread for dipping into the flavorful oil.

### Chef's Notes

- Choosing the right shrimp is crucial for this dish. Fresh, large shrimp are preferred for their texture and flavor.
- The key to perfect Gambas al Ajillo is not to overcook the shrimp. They should be just cooked through to remain tender and juicy.
- For an authentic experience, serve this dish sizzling hot, straight from the stove to the table.
