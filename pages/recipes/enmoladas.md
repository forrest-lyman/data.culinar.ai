# Enmoladas

Enmoladas, a traditional Mexican dish, are essentially tortillas dipped in mole sauce, filled with chicken, cheese, or vegetables, and then folded or rolled. Originating from Mexico, this dish showcases the complexity and richness of mole, a sauce that combines ingredients such as chili peppers, spices, chocolate, and more, creating a deep, nuanced flavor profile. Enmoladas can be found across various regions in Mexico, each adding its local twist to the recipe.

- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: 4 servings
- **Portion Size**: 2 enmoladas per serving

## Ingredients

- **For the Mole Sauce**:
  - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 1 jar (16 oz) prepared mole paste
  - 4 cups chicken broth
  - 1 tablespoon sugar (optional)
  - Salt to taste

- **For the Filling**:
  - 2 cups shredded cooked chicken (alternatively, use shredded cheese or mixed vegetables for a vegetarian option)
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

- **Additional Ingredients**:
  - 8 corn tortillas
  - 1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco or feta cheese
  - 1/4 cup white onion, finely chopped
  - 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
  - Vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Mole Sauce**:
   - In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the mole paste, breaking it apart with a spoon. Gradually whisk in the chicken broth until the mole paste is fully dissolved and the sauce is smooth. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the sauce is too thick, add more broth as needed. Taste and adjust seasoning with sugar and salt.

2. **Prepare the Filling**:
   - In a bowl, mix the shredded chicken with salt and pepper. Set aside. If using cheese or vegetables, prepare accordingly.

3. **Assemble the Enmoladas**:
   - Heat a small amount of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Lightly fry the tortillas one at a time, just until soft, not crispy. Drain on paper towels.
   - Dip each tortilla in the warm mole sauce, ensuring both sides are coated. Place on a plate, fill with the chicken mixture (or your chosen filling), and fold in half or roll up.

4. **Serve**:
   - Place two enmoladas on each plate. Drizzle with additional mole sauce, and sprinkle with crumbled cheese, chopped onion, and cilantro. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Notes

- Mole sauce is the heart of this dish. While this recipe uses prepared mole paste for convenience, traditional mole recipes involve toasting and grinding various ingredients, offering an even deeper flavor. If time allows, exploring homemade mole recipes can be a rewarding culinary adventure.
- Enmoladas can be customized with different fillings and toppings according to preference. Consider adding sliced radishes, avocado slices, or a dollop of sour cream for additional texture and flavor.
