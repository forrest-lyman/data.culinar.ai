# Bistec Ranchero

Bistec Ranchero, a robust and flavorful dish, is a staple in Mexican cuisine, particularly popular in the northern regions of the country. It features thinly sliced beef steak cooked with a vibrant mix of tomatoes, onions, and chili peppers, often served alongside rice and beans. This dish is a testament to the rich culinary traditions of Mexico, blending the heat of the peppers with the savory depth of the beef.

- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: 4 servings
- **Portion Size**: 1 steak with sauce per person

## Ingredients

- 4 thin beef steaks (about 1.5 pounds, preferably flank or sirloin)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 chiles serranos or jalapeños, seeded and sliced (adjust based on heat preference)
- 3 large ripe tomatoes, diced
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 cup beef broth or water
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Beef**: Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. **Cook the Steaks**: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the steaks and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. Remove the steaks from the skillet and set aside, keeping them warm.
3. **Sauté the Vegetables**: In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the sliced onion and cook until it starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and jalapeños, cooking for an additional minute until fragrant.
4. **Make the Sauce**: Add the diced tomatoes, ground cumin, and dried oregano to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and form a chunky sauce, about 5 minutes. Pour in the beef broth or water and stir to combine. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
5. **Combine and Serve**: Return the cooked steaks to the skillet, nestling them into the sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the steaks to absorb some of the sauce. Garnish with chopped cilantro before serving.

## Chef's Notes

- For a more authentic touch, consider using Mexican oregano instead of regular dried oregano. Its unique flavor profile adds an extra layer of complexity to the dish.
- If you prefer a spicier version, you can include the seeds of the jalapeños or add additional chili peppers according to your taste preferences.
- Bistec Ranchero can be served with a side of warm tortillas, rice, and beans, making for a hearty and satisfying meal.
