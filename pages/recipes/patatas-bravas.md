## Instructions

### Preparing the Potatoes:
1. Rinse the cubed potatoes under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.
2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer to 350°F (175°C).
3. Fry the potatoes in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot, until they are golden and crispy, about 5-7 minutes per batch.
4. Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with salt while still hot.

### Making the Bravas Sauce:
1. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in the smoked paprika and cayenne pepper, cooking for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add the crushed tomatoes and red wine vinegar. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, or until it thickens. Season with salt to taste.
4. For a smoother sauce, blend it using an immersion blender or a regular blender. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.

### Preparing the Aioli (Optional):
1. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, minced garlic, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well until smooth.

### Assembly:
1. Place the fried potatoes on a serving plate. Drizzle generously with the bravas sauce, and if using, dollop or drizzle the aioli over the top.
2. Serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.

## Chef's Notes:
- For an authentic touch, use Spanish olive oil and smoked paprika.
- The bravas sauce can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, which can enhance its flavors.
- Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper in the sauce according to your preference for heat.
