# Pozole Rojo

Pozole Rojo is a traditional Mexican soup known for its rich, hearty flavors and vibrant red color, which comes from the use of various chiles. Originating from Mexico, this dish is often served during special occasions and celebrations but is also popular as a comforting meal any time of the year. It features hominy (nixtamalized corn) and pork as its main ingredients, simmered in a broth seasoned with garlic, onions, and a blend of spices. This version of Pozole is distinguished by its red color, achieved by incorporating a blend of red chiles into the broth.

- **Origin**: Mexico
- **Yield**: Serves 8
- **Portion Size**: Approximately 1.5 cups

## Ingredients

### For the Pozole:
- 2 lbs pork shoulder, cut into 1-2 inch chunks
- 1 large white onion, quartered
- 8 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 (29 oz) cans white hominy, drained and rinsed

### For the Red Chile Sauce:
- 5 dried Ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 3 dried Guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 medium white onion, roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- Salt, to taste

### Garnishes:
- Shredded cabbage
- Sliced radishes
- Diced onions
- Dried oregano
- Lime wedges
- Tostadas or tortilla chips

## Instructions

### Preparing the Pork and Hominy:
1. In a large pot, combine the pork shoulder, quartered onion, 8 cloves of garlic, and 2 teaspoons of salt. Add enough water to cover the ingredients by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
2. Cover and simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the pork is very tender. Remove the pork pieces and set aside. Strain the broth and return it to the pot. Discard the solids.
3. Add the drained and rinsed hominy to the broth and bring to a simmer while you prepare the red chile sauce.

### Making the Red Chile Sauce:
1. Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Toast the Ancho and Guajillo chiles for about 1-2 minutes per side, until they become fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.
2. Transfer the toasted chiles to a bowl and cover them with hot water. Let them soak for about 30 minutes to rehydrate.
3. In a blender, combine the rehydrated chiles (discard the soaking water), 4 cloves of garlic, chopped onion, and about 1 cup of fresh water. Blend until very smooth.
4. Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Strain the chile mixture into the saucepan, using a fine mesh sieve to remove any solids. Add the cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt to taste. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly.

### Combining the Pozole:
1. Shred the cooked pork into bite-sized pieces and add it back into the pot with the hominy and broth.
2. Stir in the red chile sauce and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for an additional 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
3. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt as needed.

### Serving:
1. Serve the Pozole Rojo hot, with bowls of shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, diced onions, dried oregano, lime wedges, and tostadas or tortilla chips on the side for garnishing.

### Chef's Notes:
- The key to a flavorful Pozole Rojo lies in the preparation of the red chile sauce. Taking the time to properly rehydrate and blend the chiles will ensure a smooth, rich sauce that defines the dish.
- For a lighter version, chicken can be substituted for pork.
- Pozole can be made ahead and tastes even better the next day as the flavors continue to develop.
