# Smoked Salmon

Smoked salmon is a delicacy known for its rich, oily texture and smoky flavor. Originating from various regions, including Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the Pacific Northwest of the United States, this preparation method has been a traditional way to preserve salmon. It involves curing the fish in salt, sometimes sugar, and spices before smoking it at low temperatures. The result is a versatile ingredient that can be enjoyed on its own, in salads, on bagels, or as part of more elaborate dishes.

- **Origin**: Scandinavia, United Kingdom, Pacific Northwest (USA)
- **Yield**: Approximately 2 pounds
- **Portion Size**: Varies

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds of fresh salmon fillet, skin on
- 1 cup of coarse salt
- 1/2 cup of white sugar
- 1/2 cup of brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons of cracked black pepper
- 1 bunch of dill, roughly chopped (optional)
- Wood chips for smoking (preferably alder or applewood)

### For the Curing Mixture

- 1 cup of coarse salt
- 1/2 cup of white sugar
- 1/2 cup of brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons of cracked black pepper
- 1 bunch of dill, roughly chopped (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparing the Salmon

1. Begin by checking the salmon fillet for any bones. Use tweezers to remove any that you find.
2. Rinse the salmon under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.

### Curing the Salmon

1. In a bowl, mix together the coarse salt, white sugar, brown sugar, cracked black pepper, and chopped dill (if using) to create the curing mixture.
2. Lay a piece of plastic wrap that is twice the length of the salmon on a flat surface. Spread half of the curing mixture in the shape of the salmon fillet on the plastic wrap.
3. Place the salmon fillet, skin-side down, on top of the curing mixture. Cover the flesh side of the salmon with the remaining curing mixture.
4. Wrap the salmon tightly in the plastic wrap and place it in a shallow dish. Refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours, turning the salmon over every 12 hours. A liquid will form as the salmon cures; this is normal.

### Rinsing and Drying

1. After the curing time, unwrap the salmon and rinse it under cold water to remove the curing mixture.
2. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and place it on a wire rack, skin-side down. Allow it to air-dry in the refrigerator, uncovered, for 12 to 24 hours. This step helps form a pellicle on the surface of the salmon, which allows the smoke to adhere better.

### Smoking the Salmon

1. Prepare your smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions and preheat it to 150째F (65째C). Add the wood chips to the smoker.
2. Place the salmon, skin-side down, on the smoker rack. Smoke the salmon for 3 to 4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 145째F (63째C).
3. Once done, remove the salmon from the smoker and let it cool to room temperature. It can then be refrigerated and consumed within a week or frozen for longer storage.

> **Chef's Notes:**
> - The type of wood chips used can significantly influence the flavor of the smoked salmon. Alder wood provides a traditional flavor, while applewood offers a slightly sweeter note.
> - The curing time can be adjusted based on the thickness of the salmon fillet and personal preference for saltiness.
> - Smoked salmon can be served in various ways: thinly sliced on bagels with cream cheese, as part of a charcuterie board, or flaked into scrambled eggs or pasta dishes.
