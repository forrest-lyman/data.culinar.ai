# Salt Cod Cakes

Salt Cod Cakes, a delightful blend of flaked salt cod, potatoes, and herbs, fried until golden brown, are a culinary tradition rooted in various coastal regions, notably in Portugal, Spain, and the Caribbean. These cakes are a testament to the ingenuity of preserving fish, a method that dates back centuries. They offer a savory, slightly salty taste, balanced with the soft, comforting texture of potatoes, making them a versatile dish that can be enjoyed as an appetizer, main course, or even a side.

- **Origin**: Portugal, Spain, Caribbean
- **Yield**: 8 servings
- **Portion Size**: 2 cakes per serving

## Ingredients

- 500g salt cod, soaked and desalted
- 500g potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- All-purpose flour, for dusting
- Olive oil, for frying

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Salt Cod**: Begin by soaking the salt cod in cold water for 24-48 hours, changing the water every 8 hours to desalt it. Once desalted, drain and pat dry with paper towels. Flake the cod into small pieces, ensuring no bones are left.

2. **Cook the Potatoes**: Place the quartered potatoes in a large pot of boiling water and cook until they are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and mash them in a large bowl. Set aside to cool slightly.

3. **Sauté the Aromatics**: In a skillet over medium heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil. Sauté the onion and garlic until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sautéed onion and garlic to the mashed potatoes.

4. **Combine Ingredients**: To the bowl of mashed potatoes, add the flaked salt cod, parsley, thyme, and beaten eggs. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.

5. **Form the Cakes**: Dust your hands with flour, and shape the mixture into patties, about 3 inches in diameter and ½ inch thick.

6. **Fry the Cakes**: Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the cakes in batches, turning once, until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

7. **Serve**: Serve the salt cod cakes hot, accompanied by a lemon wedge or a dollop of tartar sauce.

## Chef's Notes

- **Desalting the Cod**: The key to a perfect salt cod cake is properly desalted cod. The soaking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fish; taste a small piece after soaking to ensure it's not overly salty.
- **Serving Suggestions**: These cakes can be served on a bed of mixed greens for a light meal or alongside a robust tomato sauce for a heartier dish.
- **Make Ahead**: The salt cod mixture can be prepared a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, to allow the flavors to meld. Form and fry the cakes just before serving to ensure they are crispy and fresh.
