# Classic Fish Stock

Fish stock, a cornerstone of seafood dishes, is a light, aromatic broth made from fish bones and aromatics. Originating from various coastal regions worldwide, it serves as a base for soups, sauces, and risottos, enhancing dishes with a subtle seafood flavor. This recipe yields a clear, flavorful stock, essential for any chef's repertoire.

- **Origin**: International (Coastal Regions)
- **Yield**: Approximately 2 liters
- **Portion Size**: Variable, depending on use

## Ingredients

- 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) non-oily fish bones and heads (such as sole, snapper, or cod), gills removed
- 2 liters (8 cups) cold water
- 1 medium onion, roughly chopped
- 1 leek, white part only, cleaned and roughly chopped
- 2 stalks celery, roughly chopped
- 1 medium carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 bouquet garni (thyme, parsley, bay leaf, and peppercorns tied together)
- 2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed (optional)

### For Clarification (Optional)
- 2 egg whites
- Shells from the fish (if available)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Fish Bones**: Rinse the fish bones and heads under cold running water to remove any blood and impurities. This step is crucial for a clear, clean-tasting stock.

2. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large stockpot, combine the rinsed fish bones and heads with cold water. Ensure the bones are fully submerged. Add the onion, leek, celery, carrot, bouquet garni, and garlic (if using) to the pot.

3. **Slowly Bring to a Simmer**: Place the pot over medium-low heat and slowly bring the mixture to a simmer. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface. This skimming process is essential for achieving a clear stock.

4. **Simmer Gently**: Once the stock has reached a simmer, reduce the heat to low. Allow the stock to simmer gently for 20-25 minutes. Avoid boiling, as this can make the stock cloudy and bitter.

5. **Strain the Stock**: After simmering, remove the pot from the heat. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth (or a clean kitchen towel) into a clean pot or large container. Discard the solids.

### For Clarification (Optional)
6. **Clarify the Stock**: If a clearer stock is desired, whisk the egg whites and crushed shells (if using) in a bowl. Stir this mixture into the strained stock and bring to a simmer over low heat, whisking gently. As it simmers, the egg whites will coagulate, trapping any remaining impurities. After 10 minutes, remove from heat and strain the stock again through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth.

7. **Cool and Store**: Allow the stock to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, it can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Be sure to label and date the containers.

### Chef's Notes:
- Non-oily fish are preferred for stock as oily fish can impart a strong, sometimes unpleasant flavor.
- Removing the gills from the fish heads helps prevent bitterness in the stock.
- For a richer flavor, roast the bones at 200°C (400°F) for 20 minutes before simmering. This step is optional and not traditional but adds depth to the stock.
