# Italian Cuisine

## Overview

Italian cuisine, renowned for its regional diversity, simplicity, and emphasis on high-quality ingredients, is a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet. Italy, a peninsula extending into the Mediterranean Sea, boasts a varied landscape from the rich valleys of the Po River in the north to the rugged, arid terrain of Sicily in the south. This geographical diversity, coupled with Italy's historical tapestry of foreign dominations and trade, has fostered a culinary tradition characterized by distinct regional cuisines rather than a uniform national one. The climate, ranging from the Alpine in the north to the Mediterranean in the south, influences the availability of ingredients, shaping the culinary practices of each region.
